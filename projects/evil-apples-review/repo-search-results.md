## What I Can Do Right Now:

### Option A: Review Wilson (if it's related)
Even though it's from 2014, I could:
- Review the Objective-C codebase
- Identify outdated patterns
- Suggest modernization to Swift

### Option B: Wait for Correct Repo
Once I have the right repo(s), I can:
- Full code audit
- Security review
- Performance analysis
- Create PRs for improvements
- Build new features (premium monetization)

## Next Step:

**Please provide:**
- Exact repository URL or name
- Or add me as collaborator to the private repo
- Or clarify if code is not on GitHub

Then I can start the comprehensive review and create PRs!
