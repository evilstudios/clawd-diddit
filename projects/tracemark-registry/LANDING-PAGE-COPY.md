## FAQ Section

### Headline:
**Common Questions**

#### How does blockchain verification work?
When you register a watch, we create a unique digital fingerprint and record it on the blockchain. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof record that can never be altered or forged.

#### What if I don't have my original paperwork?
No problem. You can still register your watch and begin building its digital record. Our authentication partners can help verify authenticity even without original documentation.

#### How do I transfer ownership?
When you sell a watch, you simply transfer its digital passport to the new owner. The provenance chain updates automatically, and the complete history transfers with it.

#### Will this work with any luxury watch brand?
Yes! TraceMark supports all luxury watch brands including Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Omega, and more.

#### What happens if I lose access to my account?
Your watches' blockchain records are permanent and can never be lost. We have multiple recovery options including email verification, 2FA backup codes, and ID verification.

#### Can dealers and service centers access my information?
Only with your explicit permission. You control who sees what. Service centers can log maintenance with your approval, but your portfolio remains private.
