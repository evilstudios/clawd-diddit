# Big House Express
## Strategic Growth Partnership Proposal

**Prepared for:** Bryn Stalling, COO  
**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Engagement Type:** Growth System Installation + Execution

---

## Executive Summary

Big House Express is positioned to become a leading regional fulfillment partner for scaling Shopify beauty brands. This proposal establishes a **Strategic Growth Partnership** that installs and executes a predictable client acquisition system.

**This is not consulting. This is building and running your revenue engine.**

---

## The Problem

Most 3PLs compete on price and get commoditized. Big House has an opportunity to position as a **precision partner for subscription beauty brands** that need operational stability, not just warehouse space.

But that requires:
- Clear market positioning that differentiates you
- Systematic outreach to the right decision-makers (COOs/CFOs)
- Conversion frameworks that address switching fear and risk
- Authority that makes Big House the obvious choice

This partnership installs all of that—and executes it.

## Investment

**$6,000 per month**  
**3-month minimum engagement**  
**Month-to-month thereafter**

## How This Partnership Works

### **Our Team Structure:**

**Strategy & Content Development**  
We build all positioning, messaging, frameworks, and authority assets.

**Execution & Operations**  
Our ops team handles list building, CRM setup, campaign deployment, meeting scheduling, and pipeline tracking.

**Your Role**  
- Two 1-hour strategy sessions per month (pipeline review, conversion optimization)
- Show up to sales calls with qualified prospects
- Close deals using the frameworks we provide

### **What Makes This Different:**

Most agencies hand you a strategy deck and disappear. We build it, execute it, and refine it based on results. You get **meetings on your calendar**, not just a playbook in a Google Doc.

---

## Expected Outcomes

### **Months 1-3 (Foundation):**
- Clear positioning and authority in the beauty 3PL niche
- 15–25 qualified COO-level meetings
- 1–3 new signed clients
- Structured, repeatable sales process

### **Months 4-6 (Optimization):**
- Improved response rates through messaging refinement
- Higher close rates through conversion optimization
- Predictable pipeline: 5–10 new meetings per month
- 1–2 new clients per quarter (baseline)

### **Months 7-12 (Scale):**
- Established authority position in beauty fulfillment
- Self-sustaining client acquisition system
- Foundation for regional expansion
- Increased enterprise value through recurring revenue

---

## Why This Matters Beyond Revenue

This partnership doesn't just generate leads. It positions Big House as a **scale partner**, not a commodity warehouse.

That means:
- You can command premium pricing
- Clients choose you for stability, not just cost
- You attract higher-quality brands
- You increase enterprise value (critical for future raise/exit)

Regional 3PLs that compete on price get squeezed. Regional 3PLs that own a niche and demonstrate expertise build defensible businesses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if we don't get results in 3 months?**  
A: If we follow the plan and you're not seeing qualified meetings by Month 2, we'll diagnose and adjust. If by Month 3 the system isn't working, we part ways—no hard feelings. But we've built this roadmap based on proven frameworks, so we're confident in the outcomes.

**Q: Do we own everything you build?**  
A: Yes. All positioning, messaging, assets, lists, and frameworks are yours. No licensing, no ongoing fees for materials.

**Q: What tools/software do we need?**  
A: You'll need a CRM (we recommend Pipedrive or HubSpot). We can work with whatever you have. For outreach, we handle the tooling on our end (Apollo, Instantly, Clay, etc.)—no additional cost to you.

**Q: How much of our time does this require?**  
A: Minimal. Two 1-hour strategy calls per month, plus showing up to the sales meetings we book for you. Total: ~8-10 hours/month.

**Q: Can we pause or cancel after 3 months?**  
A: Yes. After the initial 3-month engagement, it's month-to-month. Either party can cancel with 30 days' notice.
