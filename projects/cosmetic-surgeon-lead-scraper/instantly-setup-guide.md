### EMAIL 2 - Day 3
**Delay:** 3 days  
**Subject:**
```
Quick question about {{procedureInterest}}
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Following up on my email from earlier this week.

Most {{location}} clients considering {{procedureInterest}} have 2-3 main questions before booking:

1. "Will it look natural?" (Yes—we focus on subtle, confidence-boosting results)
2. "How much downtime?" (Depends on procedure—I can break this down on a call)
3. "What's the real cost?" (Transparent pricing, financing available)

If any of these resonate, let's hop on a quick 15-minute call and I'll walk you through everything.

No hard sell. Just honest answers.

**Delay:** 2 days (5 days total from start)  
**Subject:**
```
{{firstName}}, still interested?
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing one of three things:

1. You're still researching (totally fair—this is a big decision)
2. You're busy (I get it—life happens)
3. You already found someone else (congrats if so!)

If it's #1 or #2, I'm here to help—no pressure.

We have a few consultation slots left this week. If you want one, just grab a time here:

If not, no worries—I'll stop bugging you after this.

```
Considering {{procedureInterest}}? Start here.
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

I noticed you were exploring {{procedureInterest}} options in {{location}}.

If you're like most people at this stage, you probably have a few questions:
- What results can I realistically expect?
- How much does it actually cost?
- What's the recovery like?

I put together a quick guide that walks through everything—no fluff, just the honest breakdown.

Want me to send it over?

Just reply "yes" and I'll shoot it your way.

Best,
Mitch

### EMAIL 2 - Day 3
**Delay:** 3 days  
**Subject:**
```
3 things to know before booking {{procedureInterest}}
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Before you book a consultation anywhere, here are 3 things most {{location}} patients wish they knew earlier:

1. **Not all providers are the same.**  
   Board certification matters. Experience with your specific procedure matters more.

2. **The cheapest option usually isn't the best.**  
   You're trusting someone with your face/body—prioritize expertise over discounts.

3. **Ask about revision policies upfront.**  
   Reputable practices stand behind their work. If they don't offer revisions, that's a red flag.

We offer complimentary consultations so you can ask all the right questions before committing to anything.

### EMAIL 3 - Day 7
**Delay:** 4 days (7 days total from start)  
**Subject:**
```
Real {{procedureInterest}} results from {{location}} patients
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

I thought you might want to see what {{procedureInterest}} results actually look like (not the Instagram-filtered version).

All of our clients had the same concerns you probably have:
- Will it look natural?
- Is it worth the cost?
- What if I don't like it?

If you want to talk through your specific goals, I'm happy to review options on a quick 15-minute call—no commitment required.

### EMAIL 4 - Day 10
**Delay:** 3 days (10 days total from start)  
**Subject:**
```
{{firstName}}, quick question
```

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I wanted to check in.

Is {{procedureInterest}} still on your radar, or did you decide to hold off for now?

If you're still considering it, I'd love to help. If not, totally understand—no hard feelings.

Either way, just let me know so I'm not bugging you with emails you don't need.

Best,
Mitch

P.S. If timing's the issue, we offer financing options that break it into monthly payments. Happy to walk through that if helpful.
