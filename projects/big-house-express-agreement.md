**Status:** Draft - Pending Signature  
**Date Prepared:** February 17, 2026

---

## AGREEMENT TERMS

This Revenue Enablement & Performance Participation Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of __________ ("Effective Date") by and between:

**Super Massive Ventures Inc.**, a Delaware C Corporation ("SMV"), and  
**Big House Express LLC** ("Client").

SMV and Client may be referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Agreement is to engage SMV to design, deploy, and maintain a custom AI-powered Revenue Enablement System tailored specifically to Client's 3PL operations in order to generate qualified discovery conversations and revenue growth opportunities.

---

## 2. Scope of Services

SMV shall provide the following services:

- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) definition
- Switching-trigger identification logic
- Prospect data aggregation and cross-referencing
- AI-powered qualification workflows
- Lead capture and nurture sequence infrastructure
- Calendar booking automation
- CRM workflow configuration guidance
- System documentation and operational handoff

The System is custom-built for Client and is not a generic lead-list resale service.

---

## 3. Ownership

Upon payment of the Setup Fee, Client shall own all custom-built workflows, logic structures, documentation, and automation assets specifically created for Client under this Agreement.

SMV retains ownership of its proprietary frameworks, methodologies, pre-existing intellectual property, and reusable architecture components.

---

## 4. Fees

### 4.1 Setup Fee
Client shall pay a one-time, non-refundable Setup Fee of:

**$1,500**

Due upon execution of this Agreement.

### 4.2 Monthly Retainer
Client shall pay:

**$1,500 per month**

Beginning 30 days after system deployment.

Payments are due monthly in advance.

---

## 5. Revenue Share Participation

In addition to the Setup Fee and Monthly Retainer:

Client agrees to pay SMV:

**Seven percent (7%)** of Gross Monthly Revenue collected from any System-Generated Client during the first six (6) months of that client relationship.

### 5.1 Definition of System-Generated Client

A client shall be deemed "System-Generated" if:

- The prospect entered the pipeline through SMV-built workflows; OR
- The prospect responded to SMV-managed outreach; OR
- The prospect booked a call through SMV-managed calendar links; OR
- The prospect originated from SMV-curated targeting datasets; OR
- The prospect was first meaningfully engaged through the System prior to closing.

CRM timestamps and documented engagement records shall determine attribution.

### 5.2 Revenue Definition

"Gross Monthly Revenue" means total collected revenue from the client for 3PL services before expenses.

Revenue share applies only to collected funds, not invoiced but unpaid amounts.

### 5.3 Payment of Revenue Share

Revenue share payments shall:

- Be calculated monthly
- Be paid within 10 business days of Client receiving payment
- Be accompanied by a simple revenue statement

### 5.4 Survival of Revenue Share

If Client terminates this Agreement after closing a System-Generated client, revenue share obligations for that client shall remain payable for the full six-month term.

---

## 6. Minimum Term

This Agreement carries a **90-day minimum engagement period** beginning at system launch.

After 90 days, either Party may terminate with 30 days written notice.

The 90-day period allows for:

- System deployment
- Data calibration
- Campaign optimization
- Performance benchmarking

---

## 7. Performance Floor

SMV agrees to deploy and actively operate the System in a manner designed to generate qualified discovery conversations using defined ICP and switching trigger criteria.

Client acknowledges:

- SMV controls targeting infrastructure.
- Client controls pricing, service competitiveness, responsiveness, and close rate.
- No guarantee of closed clients is expressed or implied.

---

## 8. Client Responsibilities

Client agrees to:

- Respond to booked discovery calls within 24 hours
- Attend scheduled calls
- Provide accurate service and pricing information
- Maintain competitive operational standards
- Designate a decision-maker for sales discussions

Failure to meet these obligations voids performance-related claims.

---

## 9. Risk Reversal Clause

To demonstrate alignment and confidence:

If, during the initial 90-day period:

- SMV fails to deploy the agreed System infrastructure; OR
- No qualified discovery calls are generated due to SMV's failure to execute the agreed targeting framework;

SMV shall:

**Continue services at no additional monthly fee for up to 30 additional days** until the System is fully operational and actively generating qualified discovery conversations.

This clause applies only if Client fulfills all obligations under Section 8.

This clause does not apply if performance is impacted by:

- Delayed Client follow-up
- Internal sales breakdown
- Pricing misalignment
- Market conditions beyond SMV control

---

## 10. Pre-Existing Prospects

Client must provide written notice within 10 business days of Effective Date identifying any pre-existing active prospects.

Those documented prospects shall be excluded from revenue share obligations.

Failure to provide such notice constitutes agreement that prospects engaged through the System are eligible for attribution.

---

## 11. Confidentiality

Both Parties agree to maintain confidentiality regarding proprietary processes, pricing, targeting methodologies, and internal operational data.

---

## 12. Limitation of Guarantee

Client understands that:

- Revenue results depend on multiple variables outside SMV's control.
- SMV provides infrastructure and targeting expertise, not revenue guarantees.
- Enterprise growth requires operational execution by Client.

---

## 13. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall SMV's total liability exceed the total fees paid to SMV in the preceding three (3) months.

---

## 14. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

---

## 15. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior discussions or representations.

Amendments must be made in writing and signed by both Parties.

---

## FINANCIAL SUMMARY

### Setup Fee (One-Time)
**$1,500** (due upon execution)

### Monthly Retainer
**$1,500/month** (starting 30 days after deployment)

### Revenue Share
**7% of gross monthly revenue** from System-Generated clients for first 6 months of each client relationship

---

## UNIT ECONOMICS ANALYSIS

### Setup Phase
- **Revenue:** $1,500
- **Expenses:** ~$600 (infrastructure, data, ops time)
- **Profit:** **$900**

### Monthly Recurring
- **Revenue:** $1,500/month
- **Expenses:** ~$650/month (ops maintenance, data costs, system monitoring)
- **Profit:** **$850/month**

### Revenue Share Upside
- **Example:** Client closes $10k/month 3PL contract
- **SMV Share:** $700/month for 6 months = $4,200 total
- **Profit Margin:** ~85% (minimal additional costs)

### 12-Month Projection (assuming 2 System-Generated clients closed)
- Setup: $900
- Monthly (12 months): $10,200
- Revenue Share (2 clients × $700 × 6 months): $8,400
- **Total Profit (Year 1):** **$19,500**

---

## STRATEGIC NOTES

### Why This Works Despite Lower Upfront
1. **Recurring revenue** builds over time ($850/month is solid baseline)
2. **Revenue share upside** is where real profit lives (7% × client revenue)
3. **Scalable model** - can replicate with other 3PLs once proven
4. **Lower risk** for client = easier close = faster deployment

### Risk Mitigation
- 90-day minimum ensures commitment
- Revenue share survives termination (protects against early exit)
- Performance floor + risk reversal clause = confidence signal
- Attribution logic is clear and CRM-documented

### Next Steps
1. Sign agreement
2. Deploy system (30-day build window)
3. Launch campaigns
4. Book discovery calls
5. Close first System-Generated client
6. Collect revenue share for 6 months
7. Replicate model with additional 3PL clients
