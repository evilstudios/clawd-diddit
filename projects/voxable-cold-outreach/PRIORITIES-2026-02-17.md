## 🎯 Priority #1: Scale Voxable Leads & Get Clients

### Pricing Decision
**Introductory Offer (First 10 Customers):**
- **$799/month**
- **1,200 minutes** of phone calls included
- **All integrations:** SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook/Instagram DMs, website chat, email
- **Limited-time offer** (creates urgency)

**Math to Verify:**
- Cost per minute (AI voice + telephony): ~$0.08-0.15/min
- 1,200 min × $0.12/min = $144 cost
- Gross margin: $799 - $144 = $655/mo (82% margin)
- Other costs: SMS/email negligible
- **Sustainable at scale:** Yes ✅

**Positioning:**
- Normal price: $1,499/mo (anchor high)
- Launch special: $799/mo (47% discount)
- "Lock in this rate forever" (grandfathered pricing)
- Scarcity: "Only 10 spots available"
