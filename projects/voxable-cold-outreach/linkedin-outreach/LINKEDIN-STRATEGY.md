# Voxable LinkedIn Outreach Strategy

## Why LinkedIn?

Email gets 10-15% reply rate. LinkedIn messages get 25-35% reply rate for B2B.

**Target Audience:**
- Business owners of local service companies
- Job titles: Owner, Founder, CEO, President
- Industries: Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Contracting, etc.
- Company size: 1-50 employees

---

## LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

### Step 1: Connection Request (No Message)
Just send the connection request. LinkedIn allows 100-200/week safely.

**Why no message?**
- Higher accept rate (60-70% vs 30-40% with message)
- Save the pitch for after they accept

---

### Step 2: Thank You Message (Day 1 After Accept)

```
Hey {{firstName}}, thanks for connecting!

Quick question: How do you handle customer calls/texts when you're on a job or after hours?

Most {{industry}} owners I talk to say they lose 2-3 leads per week to whoever responds faster.

We built an AI receptionist that answers instantly 24/7 (calls, texts, DMs, emails). 

Worth a quick chat?
```

**Why this works:**
- Asks diagnostic question (opens conversation)
- Relates to their pain
- Quick, casual tone
- Clear CTA

---

### Step 3: Follow-up (Day 4)

```
{{firstName}},

Following up on my last message.

We help {{industry}} businesses capture every lead by answering:
- Phone calls (human-like AI voice)
- Texts & WhatsApp
- Facebook/Instagram DMs
- Website chat
- Emails

24/7. Books appointments automatically.

Want to see a quick demo? Call 267-550-0466 (it's the AI—try to stump it).

Worth 10 minutes this week?
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific value props
- Interactive demo (increases engagement)
- Low-friction ask (10 minutes)

---

### Step 4: Breakup Message (Day 8)

```
{{firstName}},

Last ping—I promise!

Are you already handling after-hours leads in a way that works? Or just not a priority right now?

If you're losing even 1-2 leads per month to slow response times, that's $2K-$10K in lost revenue.

Here's my calendar if you want to explore: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min

Either way, best of luck with {{companyName}}!
```

**Why this works:**
- Permission to close (often gets replies)
- Quantifies lost revenue
- Direct calendar link
- Respectful exit

---

## LinkedIn Automation Tools

### Option 1: Manual (Free, Safest)
- 30 connection requests/day
- 20-30 messages/day
- Time: 30 min/day
- Volume: 150 connections/week, ~100 conversations/month

### Option 2: LinkedIn Sales Navigator + Manual ($80/mo)
- Better search filters (industry, company size, job title)
- InMail credits (message without connecting)
- Lead lists and CRM features
- Still manual outreach

### Option 3: Dripify ($39-99/mo - USE WITH CAUTION)
- Automated connection requests
- Automated message sequences
- LinkedIn limits still apply
- **Risk**: Account restrictions if overdone

### Option 4: Expandi ($99/mo - SAFER AUTOMATION)
- Cloud-based (safer than Chrome extensions)
- Smart delays and randomization
- Mimics human behavior
- Lower ban risk

**Recommendation**: Start manual, scale to Sales Navigator, then consider Expandi if volume justifies it.

---

## Message Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Template 1: Direct Problem → Solution
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Saw you run {{companyName}} in {{city}}. Quick question:

How do you handle customer calls when you're on a job? Or texts that come in at 9pm?

Most {{industry}} owners lose 50%+ of leads to whoever responds first.

We built Voxable—AI receptionist that answers instantly 24/7 (calls, texts, DMs, emails). Books appointments directly into your calendar.

Worth a quick demo call? Or call 267-550-0466 to try it yourself.
```

### Template 2: Social Proof Angle
```
{{firstName}},

We're helping {{industry}} companies in {{city}} capture more leads without hiring a receptionist.

Mike (contractor in Dallas) hasn't missed a lead in 3 months. Sarah (HVAC in Phoenix) books 8-10 extra jobs/month now.

The difference? AI that answers every call/text/DM instantly—24/7.

10 min to see if this could work for {{companyName}}?
```

### Template 3: ROI Focus
```
{{firstName}},

Quick math:

If you lose 2 leads/week to slow response times, that's ~$8K-$20K/year in lost revenue.

Voxable costs less than $100/week and answers every:
- Phone call
- Text/WhatsApp
- Facebook/Instagram DM
- Website chat
- Email

24/7. Instant response. Auto-books appointments.

Worth exploring? Here's my calendar: [link]

## Content Strategy (Optional Boost)

Post weekly on LinkedIn to build credibility:

**Post Ideas:**
1. "How local businesses lose 50% of leads (and how to fix it)"
2. Case study: "How [Business] went from missing 10 calls/week to zero"
3. Poll: "What's your biggest challenge with customer communication?"
4. Video: Screen record calling the demo line, show AI in action
5. Stat: "Response time > service quality for lead conversion"

**Frequency:**
- 2-3 posts/week
- Engage with comments
- DM engaged users

---

## Next Steps

1. **Set up LinkedIn profile**
   - Professional headshot
   - Headline: "Helping [Industry] capture every lead with AI"
   - About section: Focus on customer pain points

2. **Build target list**
   - Sales Navigator search
   - Export 500 prospects
   - Segment by industry/location

3. **Launch outreach**
   - 30 connection requests/day
   - Message accepted connections
   - Track replies in spreadsheet

4. **Scale gradually**
   - Week 1: Manual
   - Week 2-4: Sales Navigator
   - Month 2: Consider automation tool

---

## Compliance & Best Practices

- ✅ Personalize every message (use {{firstName}}, {{companyName}})
- ✅ Respect LinkedIn limits (100-200 actions/day max)
- ✅ Vary message timing (don't send all at once)
- ✅ Always provide value (not just "buy my thing")
- ❌ Don't spam
- ❌ Don't use generic templates verbatim
- ❌ Don't over-automate (account risk)

---

## ROI Projection

**Conservative:**
- 500 connection requests → 300 accepts
- 300 messages → 75 replies (25%)
- 75 replies → 20 demos booked
- 20 demos → 5 trials
- 5 trials → 2 customers

**Cost:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator: $80/mo
- Time: 5 hours/week
- Cost per customer: ~$40 + time

**Revenue (if $500/mo product):**
- 2 customers = $1,000/mo MRR
- ROI: 1,150% in month 1
