## MESSAGE 3: Social Proof Follow-Up (Day 6 - If Still No Reply)

{{firstName}},

Quick update—one of the {{industry}} companies we work with just told me they haven't missed a single lead since switching to Voxable.

Every call/text/DM answered instantly. Even at 2am on Sunday.

The difference? AI that sounds completely human and books appointments automatically.

Here's my calendar if you want to see how it works: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min

## MESSAGE 4: Breakup (Day 8-10 - Final Message)

```
{{firstName}},

Last ping—I promise!

Are you already handling after-hours calls/texts in a way that works? Or just not losing enough leads to make it a priority?

If you're missing even 1-2 leads per month to slow response times, that's $2K-$10K in lost revenue annually.

Here's my calendar if you want to explore: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min

Either way, best of luck with {{companyName}}!
```

## QUICK RESPONSES (For When They Reply)

### "Tell me more"
```
Happy to!

Voxable is an AI receptionist that answers:
- Phone calls (sounds completely human—90% can't tell the difference)
- Texts & WhatsApp
- Facebook/Instagram DMs
- Website chat
- Emails

24/7. Books appointments automatically into your calendar.

Best part? It costs $500-1,500/mo depending on volume. Compare that to:
- Receptionist: $3,000+/mo + benefits
- Missed leads: $5K-$20K/year in lost revenue

Want to try it? Call 267-550-0466 (it's the AI—see if you can tell).

Or grab 10 min here: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min
```

### "How much does it cost?"
```
Depends on your volume, but typically $500-1,500/mo.

Compare that to:
- Full-time receptionist: $3,000+/mo + benefits
- Missed leads: $5K-$20K/year in lost revenue
- Answering service: $800-2,000/mo (and they're terrible)

Plus we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't book you at least one extra job this month, you pay nothing.

Or call 267-550-0466 to try it yourself right now.
```

### "Not interested right now"
```
No problem! Mind if I ask—are you already handling after-hours calls/texts in a way that works?

Or just not losing enough leads yet to make it a priority?

(Genuinely curious—helps me know who this is actually useful for)
```

### "Send me more info"
```
Sure! Here's the quick version:

**What it does:**
- Answers every call/text/DM/email instantly (24/7)
- Sounds completely human (people can't tell it's AI)
- Books appointments into your calendar automatically
- Qualifies leads and answers FAQs

**Who it's for:**
- Service businesses that get calls/texts throughout the day
- Anyone who loses leads to competitors who respond faster
- Business owners tired of missing after-hours inquiries

**Try it yourself:**
Call 267-550-0466 (that's our demo line—it's the AI)

Ask it anything. Try to stump it. See how it books appointments.

Then if you want to chat: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min

Sound good?
```

### "Can you call me?"
```
Absolutely! What's the best number to reach you at?

And what time zone are you in? I'll grab a few times that work.

(Or if you want to skip the back-and-forth, here's my calendar: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min)
```

### "This sounds like a chatbot"
```
That's the thing—it's NOT a chatbot!

It's an AI *voice* agent. When someone calls, they hear an actual human-sounding voice. Not typing. Not "press 1 for sales."

90% of people can't tell it's AI until we tell them.

Don't take my word for it though—call 267-550-0466 right now and try to tell the difference.

Then let me know what you think!
