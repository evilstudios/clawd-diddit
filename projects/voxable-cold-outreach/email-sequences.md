## Sequence 1: "The Missed Call Killer" (Direct Pain Point)

### Email 1 (Day 1) - The Hook
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "You just lost a $2,000 customer (while you were on a ladder)"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, ever lose a customer because you didn't answer fast enough?"
- C: "50% of your leads are going to your competitors. Here's why..."

**Body:**

Hey {{FirstName}},

Quick question: how many customer calls did you miss this week?

I know - you were on a job site. Or it was after 5pm. Or you were just too busy to pick up.

Here's the brutal truth: **50% of customers hire the first business that responds.**

That means every missed call is profit walking out the door.

What if EVERY call, text, DM, and email got answered instantly - even when you're swamped?

That's what our AI does for businesses like {{CompanyName}}.

Want to see how it works? Call this number: **267-550-0466**

It's our AI. See for yourself.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If the AI answers... you'll understand why your competitors are using this and you're not.

### Email 2 (Day 3) - Value Bomb
**Subject Lines:**
- A: "{{FirstName}}, following up on the AI receptionist"
- B: "This handles phone, text, FB, IG, email... everything"
- C: "Quick question about {{CompanyName}}"

**Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Not sure if you tried calling our AI demo (267-550-0466), but here's what it does:

✅ Answers EVERY phone call (even at 2am)
✅ Responds to FB/IG DMs in seconds
✅ Handles text messages instantly
✅ Books appointments into your calendar
✅ Never takes a sick day or asks for a raise

Think of it as a receptionist that works 24/7 across ALL your channels - phone, text, social, email, everything.

**Cost?** Less than hiring someone part-time.
**Setup?** Under 60 seconds.
**Risk?** Zero. Cancel anytime.

Mike B. (contractor) said: *"We haven't missed a single lead since switching over."*

### Email 3 (Day 6) - Case Study / Social Proof
**Subject Lines:**
- A: "How [similar business] went from 12 to 47 bookings/month"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, this is what happened when [competitor] got AI"
- C: "Real results: +35 more bookings per month"

**Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Let me show you something:

**Before AI Receptionist:**
- 8-10 missed calls per day
- Losing leads to competitors
- Stressed trying to answer while working

**After AI Receptionist:**
- 0 missed calls (literally zero)
- 35+ extra bookings per month
- Customers actually comment on how responsive they are

Jessica A. said: *"We started using this AI receptionist about two months ago, and honestly, I wish we'd found it sooner."*

The difference? **Instant response.**

While your competitors leave people on hold or send them to voicemail... your AI is qualifying, booking, and closing.

### Email 4 (Day 9) - Breakup Email
**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Should I take you off my list?"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, I'll stop bothering you after this"
- C: "Last one, I promise"

**Body:**

{{FirstName}},

I've sent you a few emails about our AI receptionist, but haven't heard back.

So I'm going to assume one of three things:

1. You're already handling all your calls/texts/DMs perfectly (awesome!)
2. You're not interested (totally fine!)
3. You're crazy busy and this just got buried (I get it)

If it's #3, here's the TL;DR:

**AI answers EVERY call, text, DM, email - instantly, 24/7.**
Setup in 60 seconds. Cancel anytime. 30-day guarantee.

If you want to see it in action → Call 267-550-0466
If you want to try it → [Start Free Trial]

If not, no worries! I'll stop emailing.

Either way, best of luck with {{CompanyName}}.

### Email 5 (Day 12) - Different Angle (After Hours)
**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Who's answering your phone at 8pm?"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, quick question about after-hours calls"
- C: "You're losing money while you sleep"

**Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Here's something to think about:

What happens when someone calls {{CompanyName}} at 7pm? Or texts you on Saturday morning? Or DMs your Facebook page on Sunday?

If they're going to voicemail... **they're calling your competitor next.**

Our AI makes sure that NEVER happens.

**Real example:**
Sam (locksmith) was losing 15-20 after-hours calls per month. Each worth $200-500.

That's $3,000-10,000 in lost revenue.

Now? His AI handles every call. He wakes up to booked appointments.

Want the same for {{CompanyName}}?

P.S. - This isn't about replacing you. It's about never missing an opportunity again.

### Email 6 (Day 14) - Final Follow-Up (Value Reframe)
**Subject Lines:**
- A: "{{FirstName}}, one last thing..."
- B: "The real cost of missed calls"
- C: "What if every lead said yes to {{CompanyName}}?"

**Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Last email, I promise.

Let me put this in perspective:

If you miss just **2 calls per week** at $1,000 average job value...

That's **$104,000 per year** walking away.

Now imagine:
- Every call answered instantly ✓
- Every text replied to in seconds ✓
- Every DM engaged naturally ✓
- Every lead qualified and booked ✓

**24/7. No hiring. No training. No sick days.**

That's Voxable AI.

→ [See it in action - Call 267-550-0466]
→ [Start your free trial]

If this isn't for you right now, no problem. But if you're leaving money on the table because you can't answer fast enough...

This is the fix.

P.S. - 100% money-back guarantee. You literally can't lose. But you CAN keep losing leads to competitors who respond faster.

## END OF SEQUENCE

**What happens after Day 14:**

## Follow-Up Strategy for Replies

### If they ask about pricing:
"Great question! The cost is less than hiring someone part-time, and the ROI is insane. Most clients see [X] more bookings in month 1. Want to hop on a quick 15-min call to discuss your specific setup? [Book here]"

### If they say "not right now":
"Totally understand! Mind if I check back in 3 months? In the meantime, here's a free resource: [Link to blog post about lead response time]"

### If they want a demo:
"Perfect! Two options:
1. Call 267-550-0466 right now (our AI will blow your mind)
2. Book a 15-min screen share: [calendar link]

Which works better for you?"

### If they're skeptical:
"I get it - AI can sound too good to be true. That's why we offer a 30-day guarantee. Try it risk-free. If it doesn't perform, full refund. Fair?"
