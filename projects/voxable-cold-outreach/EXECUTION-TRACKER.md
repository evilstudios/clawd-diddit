## 📞 Response Handling

When leads reply, use these quick responses:

### "Tell me more"
```
Happy to! Voxable is an AI receptionist that answers:
- Phone calls (sounds completely human)
- Texts & WhatsApp  
- Facebook/Instagram DMs
- Website chat
- Emails

24/7. Books appointments automatically into your calendar.

Want to see it in action? Call 267-550-0466 (it's the AI—try to stump it).

Or grab 10 min on my calendar: https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min
```

### "How much does it cost?"
```
Depends on your volume, but typically $500-1,500/mo.

Compare that to:
- Receptionist: $3,000+/mo + benefits
- Missed leads: $5K-$20K/year in lost revenue
- Answering service: $800-2,000/mo (and they suck)

Plus we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't book you at least one extra job, you pay nothing.

Worth a quick demo to see if it fits? https://calendly.com/supermassive/15min
```

### "Not interested right now"
```
No problem! Mind if I ask—are you already handling after-hours calls/texts in a way that works?

Or just not losing enough leads to make it a priority yet?

(Genuinely curious—helps me know who this is actually useful for)
```
