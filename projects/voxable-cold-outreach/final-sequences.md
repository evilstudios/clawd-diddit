# Voxable AI - Final Cold Email Sequences

## Your Proven 3-Email Sequence (Keep This!)

Your emails are excellent - professional, concise, and focused on their pain. I'm going to enhance them slightly and add 2-3 optional follow-ups to extend the sequence.

---

## SEQUENCE A: Your Core 3 (Enhanced)

### Email 1 (Day 1): The "Missed Opportunity" Hook
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Quick question about missed calls at {{CompanyName}}"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, are you losing 20-30% of your incoming calls?"
- C: "Missed call = missed paycheck at {{CompanyName}}?"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

I'll get straight to it:

Most local businesses miss about 20–30% of their incoming calls simply because they're busy helping the customer right in front of them.

In the world of service-based businesses, **a missed call is usually a missed paycheck.**

I'm working with Voxable, and we've developed a 24/7 AI Sales Receptionist specifically to solve this. It doesn't just take a message—it answers questions, qualifies leads, and even schedules appointments directly into your calendar while you're off the clock.

Do you have 5 minutes later this week to see how we could stop those leads from calling your competitor instead?

Best,
{{YourName}}

### Email 2 (Day 3): The "Value & Sanity" Follow-up
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Scaling {{CompanyName}} without the extra payroll"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, following up on the AI receptionist"
- C: "The hiring trap (and how to avoid it)"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

Following up on my last note.

One of the biggest hurdles I see for local owners is the **"hiring trap"**—needing a receptionist to grow, but not having the budget to pay a full-time salary plus benefits.

Voxable acts as your digital front desk for a fraction of the cost of a new hire:

✅ **Zero Hold Times:** It answers on the first ring, every time.
✅ **24/7/365:** It handles 2:00 AM inquiries while you're sleeping.
✅ **Direct Booking:** It syncs with your current tools to fill your schedule.

I'd love to show you a quick 2-minute demo of the AI in action.

Are you open to a brief chat on [Day of the week]?

Best,
{{YourName}}

**[Book a 5-min demo]** or reply with a good time to connect.

### Email 3 (Day 7): The "Low-Friction" Breakup
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "One last check-in"
- B: "Should I take you off my list, {{FirstName}}?"
- C: "Closing the loop on {{CompanyName}}"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume that capturing after-hours leads or automating your front desk isn't a top priority for {{CompanyName}} right now.

I'm going to take you off my follow-up list so I don't clutter your inbox.

If your "To-Do" list gets too long or you decide you're tired of playing phone tag with new customers, feel free to reach back out. I'd be happy to help you get an AI receptionist up and running.

Wishing you the best of luck with the business.

Best,
{{YourName}}

## OPTIONAL: Extended Sequence (Days 10-14)

**Use these if you want to extend the campaign beyond the 3-email breakup:**

### Email 4 (Day 10): The "Different Angle" - After-Hours Focus
**Subject:** {{FirstName}}, who's answering your phone at 8pm?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question:

What happens when someone needs {{CompanyName}} at 7pm on a Tuesday? Or texts you Saturday morning with an emergency?

If they're hitting voicemail... **they're calling your competitor next.**

Real example: One of our clients (a locksmith) was losing 15-20 after-hours calls per month. Each worth $200-500.

Now? His AI handles every call. He wakes up to booked appointments.

Still thinking about this for {{CompanyName}}?

**[Book a quick demo]** or call our AI: 267-550-0466

Best,
{{YourName}}

### Email 5 (Day 14): The "Final Value Bomb"
**Subject:** The real cost of missed calls at {{CompanyName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Last email, I promise.

Let me put this in perspective:

If {{CompanyName}} misses just **2 calls per week** at $800 average job value...

That's **$83,000+ per year** walking away.

Now imagine every call, text, and DM answered instantly—24/7.

**That's Voxable AI.**

→ See it in action: Call 267-550-0466
→ Or book a 5-min demo: [Calendar link]

If this isn't for you right now, no problem. But if you're leaving money on the table because you can't answer fast enough... this is the fix.

Best,
{{YourName}}

P.S. - 30-day guarantee. Zero risk. But you CAN keep losing leads to faster competitors.

## Response Handling Templates

### When they reply "Tell me more":
"Great! Two quick ways to see it in action:

1. **Call our AI right now:** 267-550-0466 (experience what your customers would)
2. **Book a 5-min demo:** [Calendar link] - I'll show you the dashboard

Which works better for you?"

---

### When they ask about pricing:
"Good question! The investment is significantly less than hiring a part-time receptionist (typically $300-600/month depending on your volume).

Most clients see ROI in the first month from the leads they would've otherwise lost.

Want to hop on a quick call to discuss {{CompanyName}}'s specific setup? [Book here]"

---

### When they say "not interested":
"No worries at all, {{FirstName}}! Appreciate you letting me know.

Mind if I check back in 3-6 months in case things change? 

Either way, best of luck with {{CompanyName}}!"

---

### When they say "not right now / too busy":
"Totally understand - I know how it goes.

If things calm down or this becomes a priority, feel free to reach back out anytime: [Your Email]

In the meantime, here's a quick tip: [Link to free resource about lead response time]"

---

### When they ghost (no response after sequence):
**Tag in Instantly.ai as:**
- "No Response - Nurture List"
- Move to quarterly touch-base sequence (1 email every 3 months with value)

---
