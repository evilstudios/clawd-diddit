   - Company size? Revenue range?
   - Industry focus?
   - Geographic preferences?

3. **What's your current sales process?**
   - Discovery call → demo → proposal → close?
   - Average sales cycle length?

4. **What tools do you currently use?**
   - CRM?
   - Email?

## Why This Approach Works

**Traditional lead gen fails because:**
- Generic lists (no timing consideration)
- Spray-and-pray volume (low quality)
- No optimization (set it and forget it)
- Disappears when you stop paying

**This Phase 1 pilot succeeds because:**
- ✅ Trigger-based targeting (right time, right company)
- ✅ Quality over quantity (500-1K vs. 10K junk leads)
- ✅ Continuous optimization (A/B testing, weekly reviews)
- ✅ Proof-of-concept (results before big investment)
