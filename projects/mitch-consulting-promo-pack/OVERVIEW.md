# Mitch Mermagen - Strategic Execution Architect

**Positioning**: I don't just advise—I execute. I transform ambitious visions into operational reality.

---

## The Problem I Solve

Growth-stage companies and innovation teams know *what* they want to build, but struggle with:
- Shipping too slowly (engineering bottlenecks)
- Breaking things at scale (operational chaos)
- Competing priorities (no clear roadmap)
- Strategy/execution disconnect (vision doesn't translate)

**I bridge the gap between strategy and execution.**

---

## What Makes Me Different

**Most consultants give you a deck and disappear.**

I:
✅ Roll up sleeves and implement (not just advise)  
✅ Train teams while building systems (knowledge transfer built-in)  
✅ Leave you with working infrastructure, not just ideas  
✅ Draw from active operator experience (running 2 companies, 4 products, 3 service businesses)
