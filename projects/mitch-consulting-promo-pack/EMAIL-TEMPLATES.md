# Email Templates - Consulting Outreach

## Template 1: Cold Outreach (LinkedIn/Email)

**Subject**: Quick question about [Company]'s delivery speed

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [recent news/growth/challenge]. Congrats on the momentum.

Quick question: Are you happy with how fast your team ships?

I ask because I've spent 16 years helping companies like yours (Capital One, Super Massive Ventures) break through delivery bottlenecks. Recent wins:

• Saved $1.5M through automation at Capital One
• 30% faster release cycles across 12 Agile teams
• Built AI service from zero to live in 30 days (2026)

I don't do typical consulting. I build working systems alongside your team, then train them to maintain it. Most engagements pay for themselves in 6-12 months.

Would a 15-minute call make sense? Happy to share how others in [industry] solved similar challenges.

Best,  
Mitch

## Template 2: Warm Intro Follow-Up

**Subject**: Following up on [Introducer]'s intro

Hi [Name],

[Introducer] mentioned you're working on [specific challenge/project]. That's exactly what I help with.

Context: I'm a Strategic Execution Architect who spent 8 years at Capital One leading Agile transformations (12 teams, 50+ people, $1.5M saved). Now I run Super Massive Ventures and help growth-stage companies ship faster without breaking things.

Recent example from this month:
- Built AI service business from zero → live campaign in 30 days
- 230 qualified leads, automated outreach, first revenue in 24 hours

I specialize in 90-day transformation engagements where I actually build systems with your team (not just give advice). ROI is typically 30-40% faster delivery + measurable cost savings.

Would you be open to a 20-minute discovery call? I can share specific examples relevant to [their challenge].

Available [day/time options].

Best,  
Mitch

## Template 3: Response to Inquiry

**Subject**: Re: Consulting inquiry

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! Happy to help with [their stated challenge].

Quick background: I've spent 16 years turning ambitious visions into operational reality:

**Corporate**: 8 years at Capital One (led 12 Agile teams, $1.5M saved, 30% faster releases) + 4 years at JPMorgan Chase

**Current**: President of Super Massive Ventures (40% efficiency boost, 95% project success rate)

**Recent work** (Feb 2026):
- AI service launch: 0 → live campaign in 30 days
- Creator platform MVP: concept → deployable in 1 day  
- Infrastructure migration: $36K/year savings in 2 days

I offer 90-day transformation engagements ($50K-$150K depending on scope):
- Tech Velocity Unlock (CI/CD, automation, team training)
- Strategic Execution Sprint (roadmap → momentum)
- Operational Scale-Up (processes, infrastructure, capacity planning)
- Rapid MVP Build (30-45 day product launches)

Unlike typical consultants, I don't just advise—I build systems with your team and train them to maintain it.

Next step: 30-minute discovery call to understand your specific challenge and see if there's a fit.

Available [time slots]. Does one work for you?

Best,  
Mitch

P.S. - Attached is a one-pager with case studies if you want more detail.
