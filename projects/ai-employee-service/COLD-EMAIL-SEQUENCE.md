# Cold Email Sequence: AI Employee Service

**Target Audience:** B2B SaaS founders, agency owners, e-commerce brands (1-50 employees)  
**Goal:** Book discovery calls  
**Sequence Length:** 5 emails over 14 days  
**Expected Reply Rate:** 5-10%

## 📧 EMAIL 1: The Problem (Day 0)

**Subject Line Options:**
- `{{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}`
- `Spending 20+ hours/week on busywork?`
- `{{firstName}} - your time is worth more than this`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} is growing fast — congrats on that.

But I'm guessing you're spending 15-20 hours a week on things that don't actually move the needle:

• Inbox management (triage, scheduling, follow-ups)
• CRM updates (logging calls, moving deals)
• Data entry & admin work
• Responding to the same questions over and over

**Most founders handle this by:**
1. Hiring a VA (expensive, training overhead, timezone issues)
2. Using workflow tools (Zapier/Make — helpful but limited)
3. Just grinding through it (burnout waiting to happen)

**There's a fourth option:** An AI Employee that actually thinks, learns, and handles this stuff autonomously.

Not a chatbot. Not a workflow tool. An actual intelligent assistant that works 24/7 and costs less than 1% of a full-time hire.

Interested in seeing how it works?

Best,  
Mitch

## 📧 EMAIL 2: The Solution (Day 3)

**Subject Line:**
- `Re: {{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Following up on my note from Tuesday.

To clarify what I mean by "AI Employee":

**Think of it as your smartest team member—except it's software.**

It integrates with your existing tools (email, CRM, Slack, calendar) and handles tasks like:
• Qualifying leads (research, score, route to sales)
• Managing your inbox (draft responses, flag urgent items)
• Updating your CRM (log activities, move deals)
• Scheduling meetings (coordinate calendars, send invites)
• Generating reports (weekly summaries, pipeline dashboards)

**Real example:** One of our clients (SaaS founder, 12 employees) was spending 15 hours/week on email and scheduling. Now his AI Employee handles 90% of it. He's reclaimed his calendar and actually focuses on product development.

**Setup:** 2-4 weeks  
**Cost:** $5k setup + $2k/month (less than 1 week of salary)  
**ROI:** Most clients save 15-25 hours/week

Worth a quick chat?

Best,  
Mitch

## 📧 EMAIL 3: Social Proof (Day 7)

**Subject Line:**
- `How {{similar_company}} saved 20 hours/week`
- `Re: {{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Last note from me (promise).

I wanted to share a quick story that might resonate:

**{{similar_company}}** (also in {{industry}}) was dealing with the same thing—founder drowning in ops work, team stretched thin, growth stalling because no one had time to actually execute.

They brought on an AI Employee to handle:
• Lead qualification & routing
• CRM management
• Meeting scheduling
• Customer support triage

**Result:** 20 hours/week back to focus on growth. Revenue up 40% in the next quarter (correlation, but still).

**If you're curious how this would work for {{company}}, I'd be happy to walk through it.**

No pressure—just a 15-minute conversation to see if it makes sense.

Here's my calendar: [LINK]

Best,  
Mitch

P.S. — Even if it's not a fit right now, I'm happy to share some automation tips that might help. Just reply "tips" and I'll send them over.
```

## 📧 EMAIL 4: Break-Up (Day 10)

**Subject Line:**
- `Should I close your file?`
- `Last check-in`
- `Re: {{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing one of these is true:

1. **Not a priority right now** (totally fair)
2. **Inbox overload** (ironically, exactly what we solve)
3. **Not interested** (also fair!)

If it's #1 or #2, just reply "Later" and I'll check back in Q3.

If it's #3, no worries—I'll close your file.

Either way, hope {{company}} crushes it this year.

Best,  
Mitch
```

## 📧 EMAIL 5: Value-Add (Day 14)

**Subject Line:**
- `Free automation tips for {{company}}`
- `One last thing before I go`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{firstName}},

Since I haven't heard back, I figured I'd send you something useful anyway.

**3 quick automation wins for {{industry}} companies:**

**1. Auto-qualify leads before they hit your sales team**
Use a simple webhook + scoring system to filter out bad-fit prospects. Saves ~5 hours/week of discovery calls.

**2. Auto-update your CRM from email**
Parse email signatures and conversations to automatically log activities. Your CRM actually stays current for once.

**3. Weekly pipeline reports on autopilot**
Set up a scheduled job to pull CRM data, format it, and email it every Monday morning. No more manual reporting.

**If you want a deeper dive on any of these, just reply.**

Even if we never work together, hope this helps.

Best,  
Mitch

## 🎯 Sequence Strategy

### **Email Cadence:**
- Day 0: Problem awareness
- Day 3: Solution introduction
- Day 7: Social proof
- Day 10: Break-up (pattern interrupt)
- Day 14: Value-add (leave on good terms)

### **Key Principles:**

1. **Personalization:**
   - Use {{firstName}}, {{company}}, {{industry}}
   - Reference similar companies in their space
   - Mention specific pain points for their industry

2. **Pattern Interrupt:**
   - Email 4 (break-up) often gets the most responses
   - Gives them permission to say "not interested"
   - Or triggers FOMO ("wait, I was interested!")

3. **Value First:**
   - Email 5 gives free value even if they never reply
   - Positions you as helpful, not just salesy
   - Opens door for future conversations

4. **Low Pressure:**
   - Never guilt-trip or be pushy
   - Give easy outs ("reply 'not interested' and I'll stop")
   - Respect their time

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Per 100 Leads Contacted:**
- **Open Rate:** 60-70% (based on personalization)
- **Reply Rate:** 5-10% (5-10 responses)
- **Interested Responses:** 3-5 (30-50% of replies)
- **Booked Calls:** 2-3 (conversion from interest)
- **Closed Deals:** 1 (50% close rate on calls)

### **ROI Calculation:**
- **Campaign cost:** $0 (if using Instantly on existing plan)
- **Time investment:** ~2 hours to set up + write sequences
- **1 client at $5k setup + $2k/month** = $29k first year
- **Break-even:** 1 client covers setup time 14x over

---

## 🔧 Implementation in Instantly.ai

1. **Create campaign** in Instantly

## 💡 Personalization Variables

### **Required:**
- `{{firstName}}` - Lead's first name
- `{{company}}` - Company name

### **Optional (but recommended):**
- `{{industry}}` - Their industry (SaaS, agency, e-commerce, etc.)
- `{{similar_company}}` - A comparable company in their space
- `{{pain_point}}` - Specific challenge they likely face

### **Example Personalization:**

**Generic:**
> "Most companies struggle with email management."

**Personalized:**
> "Most SaaS founders at the $1M-5M stage struggle with lead qualification eating up 10+ hours/week."

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing Ideas

### **Subject Lines to Test:**
- Direct question vs curiosity gap
- With vs without name
- Benefit-driven vs problem-aware

### **Email 1 Variations:**
- Short (50 words) vs medium (100 words)
- Bullet points vs paragraphs
- Lead with pain vs lead with solution

### **CTA Variations:**
- "Interested?" vs "Worth a chat?" vs "Want to see how it works?"
- Link to calendar vs link to calculator vs "just reply"

## 📝 Response Templates

### **When They Reply "Interested":**
```
Great! Let's hop on a quick call to see if this makes sense for {{company}}.

Here's my calendar: [LINK]

Before we chat, any specific tasks you'd love to automate? (Helps me prepare)
```

### **When They Reply "Not Right Now":**
```
No problem! Mind if I check back in Q3?

In the meantime, is there anything automation-related I can help with? Happy to share some quick wins.
```

### **When They Reply "Not Interested":**
```
Totally fair—appreciate the response!

If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me.

Best of luck with {{company}} 🚀
```

### **When They Ask About Pricing:**
```
Happy to walk through pricing!

Quick version:
• $5k setup (one-time)
• $2k/month ongoing

But the real number that matters is ROI. Most clients save 15-25 hours/week.

If your time is worth $150/hour (conservative for a founder), that's $9k-15k/month in value for a $2k investment.
