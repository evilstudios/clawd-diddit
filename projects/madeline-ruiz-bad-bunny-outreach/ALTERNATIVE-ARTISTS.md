**Pitch angle**: "Styled Diana Ross, Fania All Stars, now bringing legend expertise to Rimas artists"

**Strategy**:
1. Offer styling for Tainy's solo projects/appearances
2. Build rapport through shared Bad Bunny connection
3. Ask for introduction/referral to Bad Bunny's team
4. Position as "stylist for the producers and artists shaping Latin music"

---

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Rauw Alejandro, Myke Towers, Sech**
**Why**: Rising stars, more accessible, fashion-conscious

**Strategy**:
1. Pitch as "veteran stylist bringing high-fashion expertise to new generation"
2. Style for music videos, award shows, or editorial shoots
3. Build portfolio of successful Latin artist collaborations
4. Use momentum to approach bigger names

### **CREDIBILITY BOOST: Daddy Yankee, Don Omar**
