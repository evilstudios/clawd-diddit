## EMAIL 1: Management Team (Rimas Entertainment)

**Subject**: Styling Collaboration Inquiry - Madeline Ruiz

**To**: [Management contact at Rimas Entertainment]

---

Hello [Name],

I'm reaching out on behalf of Madeline Ruiz, a celebrity stylist with over 45 years of experience styling music legends including Diana Ross, the Fania All Stars, Melba Moore, and fashion icons like Jerry Hall and Iris Apfel.

Madeline has followed Bad Bunny's incredible trajectory and bold fashion evolution with great admiration. Having worked extensively with Latin music pioneers (Fania All Stars) and as a former fashion editor for Univision's Más Magazine, she brings a unique understanding of both Latin culture and global fashion vision.

**What Madeline brings**:
- 45+ years styling music legends and public figures
- Fashion editor background (Cosmopolitan, Essence, Más Magazine)
- Luxury brand relationships (Gucci, Norma Kamali, major fashion houses)
- Deep understanding of artist needs across tours, videos, and public appearances

She would love to explore potential collaboration opportunities with Bad Bunny for styling projects—whether for tours, music videos, award shows, or editorial shoots.

I've attached a one-page overview of her background and portfolio highlights. Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential collaboration?

Thank you for considering this opportunity.

Best regards,  
[Your name]  
On behalf of Madeline Ruiz
