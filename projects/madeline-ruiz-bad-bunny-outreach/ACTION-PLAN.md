### If Communication Goes Cold
- **Wait**: 3-6 months before trying again
- **Stay visible**: Social media, industry events
- **Indirect**: Try to meet at events, conferences

### If They're Interested but Timing is Wrong
- **Stay connected**: Quarterly check-ins
- **Offer**: "Available for future projects"
- **Meanwhile**: Build portfolio with other artists

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Stalking/over-persistence** - One follow-up, then move on  
❌ **Desperate tone** - Always professional, confident  
❌ **Name-dropping without context** - Explain why Diana Ross matters  
❌ **Ignoring current stylist** - Respect existing relationships  
❌ **Social media spam** - Quality over quantity  
❌ **Unprofessional materials** - Everything must look high-end  

---

## Green Lights to Watch For

✅ **Email opened** (if using tracking)  
✅ **LinkedIn profile views** from Rimas team  
✅ **Instagram story views** from team members  
✅ **Response from any channel** (even "not now" is progress)  
✅ **Request for portfolio/more info**  
✅ **Meeting scheduled**  

---

## Final Reality Check

### What to Expect
- **Response rate**: 5-10% for cold outreach to major artists
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months from first contact to collaboration (if successful)
- **Rejections**: Most won't respond—that's normal
- **Patience**: Building relationships with major artists takes time

### Best Case Scenario
- Rimas responds within 2 weeks
- Meeting scheduled within 1 month
- Project discussion within 2-3 months
- Collaboration within 6 months

### Realistic Scenario
- Multiple touchpoints over 6 months
- Building relationship through Jhay Cortez first
- Bad Bunny collaboration within 12 months

### Backup Plan
- Even if Bad Bunny doesn't happen, styling other Latin artists is valuable
- Build reputation in Latin music scene
- Position as "the legend who styles legends AND the next generation"
