- Fallback: Optimize around bugs (set expectations in ads/listings)

**Risk: AppLovin doesn't scale profitably**
- Mitigation: Start with small test budget, strict ROAS gates
- Fallback: Focus on organic growth + ASO

**Risk: Market saturation**
- Mitigation: Expand to new geos, find new audiences
- Fallback: Increase monetization per user (new IAP options)

**Risk: Competitive pressure**
- Mitigation: Improve product quality, build community
