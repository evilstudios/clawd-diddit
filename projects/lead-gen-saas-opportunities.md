## Why Cosmetic Surgeons Are #1

**The math:**
- Average facelift: $15,000
- Average breast augmentation: $8,000
- Average procedure value: ~$10,000
- Conversion rate from qualified lead: 5-10%

**If you deliver 50 leads/month:**
- 3-5 convert = $30k-50k in procedure revenue
- Your $1,500/month fee = 3-5% of generated revenue
- **That's an insane ROI for them**

**Plus:**
- They're already used to paying $200-500 per lead via Google Ads
- Your system would deliver warmer, more qualified leads for less
- High profit margins on procedures = room to pay for lead gen

## Why This Works Better Than Big House Model

**Big House model:** Custom, high-touch, manual work = hard to scale beyond 5 clients

**This model:** 
- Same core tech (scraping + enrichment)
- More standardized (less custom strategy work)
- Higher volume, lower touch
- Easier to productize
- Can scale to 50-100 customers with 1-2 ops people

**Revenue comparison:**
- **5 Big House clients:** $30k/month ($19.5k net after ops)
- **20 cosmetic surgeons:** $24k/month ($18k+ net, less ops intensity)
- **50 cosmetic surgeons (self-service SaaS):** $50k/month ($40k+ net, minimal ops)

**Recommendation:** Test with cosmetic surgeons first. If it works, you have a playbook to replicate across CRE and HVAC next.
