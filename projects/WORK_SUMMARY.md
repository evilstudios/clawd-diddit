## 💡 My Recommendation

**Start with the highest-leverage activities:**

1. **Week 1:** Landing pages + email capture
2. **Week 2:** Social media launch + first content pieces  
3. **Week 3:** SEO content sprint + paid ad tests
4. **Week 4:** Analyze, optimize, double down on winners

**The math is simple:**
- 3,125 total subscribers needed
- 90 days to get there
- = 35 new subscribers per day average

**It's aggressive but doable with the right execution.**
