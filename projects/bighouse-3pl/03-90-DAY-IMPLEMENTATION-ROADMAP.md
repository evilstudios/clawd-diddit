## Risk Mitigation

**What if we don't hit targets?**

We've built in multiple safety nets:

1. **Weekly monitoring** – Catch issues early
2. **Bi-weekly strategy calls** – Adjust tactics in real-time
3. **A/B testing** – Always have a backup approach
4. **Transparent reporting** – You see everything we see
5. **3-month pilot** – Low commitment to test fit

**If we miss targets by Day 90:**
- We'll do a full post-mortem (what went wrong)
- We'll offer options: adjust and continue, or part ways
- You keep all software we built (it's yours)
