# Big House 3PL Growth Partnership Proposal

**Prepared for:** Bryn Stalling & Partner, Big House Express LLC  
**Prepared by:** Mitch Leggs, Vertex AI Ops  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Subject:** AI-Powered Lead Generation & Conversation Engineering System

---

## Executive Summary

Big House Express has a **sales problem disguised as a lead problem.**

Your sales team is strong—30 years of experience proves that. But they're spending time on:
- Cold calling unqualified leads
- Chasing prospects who aren't ready
- Fighting price-first conversations
- Relying on generic lead lists that don't convert

**The result:** Great salespeople, underwhelming pipeline.

This proposal outlines a **fundamentally different approach**: not lead generation, but **conversation engineering**—a system that creates high-intent conversations with operators who are already experiencing fulfillment friction.

---

## The Problem with Traditional Lead Generation

Most lead providers optimize for:
- ❌ Lead volume (quantity over quality)
- ❌ Generic outbound tactics
- ❌ Surface-level targeting (title + industry)
- ❌ One-size-fits-all messaging

**The result:** Your sales team wastes time separating signal from noise.

---

## Our Approach: Conversation Engineering

We don't generate leads. We **engineer conversations** with:

✅ **Trigger-based targeting** – Companies experiencing fulfillment pain *right now*  
✅ **Authority positioning** – Positioning Big House as a peer, not a vendor  
✅ **Situational messaging** – Outreach that aligns with existing urgency  
✅ **Custom AI systems** – Bespoke software (not rented SaaS) that gets smarter over time  

---

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Lead Gen:
- Buys generic lists
- Blasts emails at scale
- Measures volume metrics
- Stops when you stop paying

### Vertex AI Ops Partnership:
- **Builds custom targeting systems** using AI
- **Engineers high-intent conversations**
- **Measures conversation quality**
- **Systems remain yours** and improve over time

**Key differentiator:** We're a **Software & AI Technology company**, not a marketing agency. We build systems that compound value, not campaigns that expire.

---

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Conversation Engineering (Not Lead Volume)

We design outreach to earn **short, exploratory calls** with:
- Founders and Ops leaders
- Brands experiencing fulfillment friction
- Teams approaching growth or peak-season inflection points

**Outcome:** Sales talks to fewer people, but the *right* people—at the *right* time.

---

### 2. Authority-Led Positioning

Big House is positioned as:
- An **operational authority** in scaling fulfillment
- A **peer** to founders and COOs
- A **long-term partner**, not a transactional vendor

We **avoid** leading with:
- Price
- Speed claims
- Commodity fulfillment messaging

We **lead with:**
- Operational insight
- Peer-level conversations
- Visibility and credibility mechanisms

**Outcome:** Reduces early price pressure and reframes the relationship.

---

### 3. Trigger-Based Targeting

Targeting driven by **situational signals**, not just firmographics:

- Brands outgrowing in-house fulfillment
- Operators burned by a prior 3PL
- Teams preparing for peak demand
- Brands whose growth is constrained by fulfillment reliability

**Outcome:** Outreach aligns with existing urgency, not manufactured demand.

---

### 4. Software & AI as a Strategic Advantage

Unlike traditional agencies or lead vendors, we build **bespoke internal systems** tailored specifically to Big House.

**What we build:**
- Custom lead intelligence engine
- Trigger detection algorithms (hiring posts, reviews, growth signals)
- Automated enrichment pipelines
- Real-time scoring and prioritization
- Performance dashboards

**Outcome:** A repeatable, defensible pipeline engine—not a one-off campaign.

---

### 5. Hooks Over Campaigns

Channels and cadences are execution details. The strategic advantage comes from **hooks**:

- Clear psychological reasons to respond
- Value delivered *before* asking for commitment
- Calls positioned as conversations, not sales pitches

**When hooks are right, channels perform.**

---

## Expected Outcomes

This strategy is designed to produce:

✅ **Fewer, higher-quality sales conversations**  
✅ **Shorter sales cycles**  
✅ **Less price sensitivity**  
✅ **Better long-term client fit and retention**  
✅ **Increasing efficiency over time** as software systems compound  

---

## Bottom Line

This approach does **not** aim to get Big House 3PL "more leads."

It aims to:

1. **Position Big House** as the clear operational partner for serious eCommerce brands
2. **Systematically create conversations** with companies already primed to switch or scale
3. **Support growth with custom Software and AI systems** that improve visibility and lead quality over time
