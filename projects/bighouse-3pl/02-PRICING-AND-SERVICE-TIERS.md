## ROI Justification

### Current State (Estimated):
- **Current spend:** ~$2,000-3,000/month on lead generators
- **Result:** Low-quality cold calls, poor conversion
- **Sales team:** Underutilized (30-year vet spinning wheels)

### With Tier 2 ($7,500/month):
- **Qualified meetings:** 10-15/month (conservative)
- **Conversion rate:** 15-20% (industry standard)
- **New clients/quarter:** 2-3 (conservative)

**Average 3PL client value:** $50,000-150,000/year

### Break-Even Analysis:
- **Investment:** $7,500/month × 3 months = $22,500
- **Result:** 2 new clients = $100,000-300,000/year in revenue
- **ROI:** 4x-13x return in first quarter

**But the real value:**
- Custom software you **own** (not rented SaaS)
- Authority positioning that **compounds**
- System that gets **smarter over time**
- Elimination of other lead gen costs

---

## Contract Structure

### Pilot Phase (Recommended)
**Duration:** 3 months

**Success Metrics:**

**If metrics are hit:**

## Comparison: Us vs. Traditional Lead Gen

| Feature | Traditional Lead Gen | Vertex AI Ops |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Pricing** | $2,000-5,000/month | $4,500-12,000/month |
| **Lead Volume** | High (500-1,000/mo) | Lower (focus on quality) |
| **Lead Quality** | Generic lists | Trigger-based, high-intent |
| **Custom Software** | ❌ Rented SaaS | ✅ Built & owned by you |
| **Authority Building** | ❌ None | ✅ SEO, content, positioning |
| **Messaging** | Generic templates | Custom, situational hooks |
| **Optimization** | Monthly campaigns | Continuous AI learning |
| **After You Stop** | Nothing remains | Software & authority stay |
| **Cost per Meeting** | $200-400 | $500-750 (but higher intent) |
| **Close Rate** | 5-10% | 15-25% (higher quality) |

**Bottom line:** We cost more upfront but deliver **higher-intent conversations** and **compounding systems** that traditional lead gen can't match.

## Why Tier 2 is Recommended

**Tier 1** proves the concept but doesn't build lasting authority.  
**Tier 3** is overkill until you've proven product-market fit with our approach.  
**Tier 2** hits the sweet spot:

✅ Enough volume to get statistically significant results (60-90 days)  
✅ Authority building differentiates you from competitors  
✅ Room to scale if it works (move to Tier 3)  
✅ Room to adjust if budget is tight (drop to Tier 1 after proving value)

## Next Steps

1. **Review pricing tiers**
2. **Discuss with your partner**
3. **Choose starting tier** (we recommend Tier 2)
4. **Complete discovery questions** (document 05)
5. **Schedule kickoff call**
