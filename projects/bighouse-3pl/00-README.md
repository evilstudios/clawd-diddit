## 🚀 Why This Works

**Traditional lead gen fails because:**
- Generic lists (no timing consideration)
- Commodity positioning (you're one of many)
- Volume metrics (quantity over quality)
- Nothing remains when you stop

**This approach succeeds because:**
- Trigger-based targeting (right time, right company)
- Authority positioning (you're the obvious choice)
- Quality metrics (high-intent conversations)
- Compounding systems (value persists and grows)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By Day 90, we aim to deliver:

✅ **10-15 qualified meetings** booked  
✅ **2-4 active opportunities** in pipeline  
✅ **$200k-600k pipeline value** created  
✅ **Custom software suite** (lead intelligence, CRM integration, dashboard)  
✅ **Authority foundation** (SEO, blog content, LinkedIn presence)  
✅ **50% cost reduction** vs. current lead gen (per meeting)  

**If we hit these metrics:** Continue for 6 months and scale to Tier 3.  
**If we miss:** Part ways with no hard feelings. You keep all software we built.
