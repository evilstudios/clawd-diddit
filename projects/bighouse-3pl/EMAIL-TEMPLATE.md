**Subject:** Big House 3PL Growth Partnership Proposal

---

Hi Bryn,

Great talking with you on Tuesday. As promised, here's the complete proposal for our partnership.

I've put together a full package that outlines how we'd build a custom AI-powered system to generate high-intent conversations for Big House—not just more leads, but the *right* leads at the *right* time.

## What's Inside:

**📄 Executive Proposal** – The main pitch (10-min read)  
**💰 Pricing & Service Tiers** – Three options, I recommend Tier 2  
**📅 90-Day Roadmap** – Week-by-week implementation plan  
**📊 Differentiation Matrix** – How this is different from traditional lead gen  
**❓ Discovery Questions** – For you and your partner to complete  

**Recommendation:** Start with **Tier 2** ($7,500/month) for a **3-month pilot**.

**Goal:** 10-15 qualified meetings and 2-4 pipeline opportunities by Day 90.

## Key Differentiators:

✅ **Custom software** (you own it, not rented)  
✅ **AI-powered trigger detection** (brands experiencing fulfillment pain *right now*)  
✅ **Authority positioning** (peer, not vendor)  
✅ **Systems that compound** (value persists and grows over time)  

This isn't lead generation—it's **conversation engineering**.

## Next Steps:

1. **Review the proposal** (especially the Executive Summary and Pricing)
2. **Discuss with your partner**
3. **Complete the discovery questions** (15 minutes)
4. **Let's schedule a follow-up call** (you + partner + me)

I'm available early next week. Here's my calendar: [YOUR CALENDLY LINK]

**Questions?** Just reply to this email or call me: [YOUR PHONE]

Looking forward to building your pipeline engine.

— Mitch

P.S. — If you're tired of generic lead lists and want a system that actually compounds value, this is it. Let's talk soon.
