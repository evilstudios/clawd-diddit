## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Organic social posting (no ad spend)
- Value-first content (not spammy)
- Existing product with 147 customers (social proof)

**Medium Risk:**
- Reddit can be unpredictable (mods, downvotes)
- Twitter algorithm favors engagement (need replies)

**Mitigation:**
- Follow subreddit rules strictly
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour
- Don't be salesy in responses
- Provide value even if they don't buy

---

2. **Post first Reddit thread** (r/LocalLLaMA)
3. **Post first Twitter thread** ("Stop Running Bots")

## Questions to Resolve

2. **Can I give free units to influencers?** (for reviews/coverage)
3. **What's the refund policy?** (in case someone asks)
4. **Are there any competitors I should know about?**
