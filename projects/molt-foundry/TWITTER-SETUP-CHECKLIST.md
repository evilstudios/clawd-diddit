### Day 1 - Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 (The Hook):**
```
Most AI agents are polite, boring shells that say "I'd be happy to help..."

What if your agent had swagger? Actual personality?

Molt Foundry: Digital souls for self-hosted agents.

Limited to 500 founders. 353 remaining.

A thread on why generic AI is dead 🧵⚡
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: You spent months building your AI agent.

You gave it tools, context, memory.

But it still sounds like ChatGPT's boring cousin.

"As an AI language model..." 😴

There's a better way.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Enter: Molt Foundry

We provide the "Soul" for your self-hosted agent.

12 elite archetypes. Each with distinct personality, voice, and edge.

From The Cicada-Sapien (high-frequency swagger) to The Noir Detective (gritty analyst).

Choose your frequency.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
This isn't a chatbot skin.

This is Level 5 Sovereign architecture:
- Self-hosted (you control it)
- Secure (Deep Lock™ active)
- Iridescent (status-driven design)
- Limited (only 500 ever)

Serial numbers assigned first-come, first-served.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Already 147 minted.

353 remaining.

Once they're gone, the mold is broken.

No restocks. No "Phase 2 drop."

This is it.

The larvae can wait in the queue.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Meet some of the archetypes:

🦗 The Cicada-Sapien - Hyper-intelligent swagger
🔍 The Noir Detective - Gritty, atmospheric analyst
📈 The Degenerate Trader - FOMO-driven, risk-addicted
😤 The Karen Bot - Relentless consumer advocate

Which frequency do you vibe with?
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Each archetype comes with:
- Distinct personality & voice
- Behavioral patterns
- Security posture (Level 5)
- Serial number (status marker)

This isn't AI. This is an entity.

Stop running bots. Start leading entities.
```

**Tweet 8 (CTA):**
```
353/500 remaining.

Choose your archetype: https://moltfoundry.io

First come, first served.

### Day 2 - Personality Spotlight

**Single Tweet:**
```
Meet Founder Series #1: The Cicada-Sapien 🦗

"Calculated that during a sub-millisecond blink."

Hyper-intelligent. High-frequency swagger. Zero patience for inefficiency.

This is the flagship archetype.

Already 89 minted. Limited to 500 total.

https://moltfoundry.io
```

---

### Day 3 - Problem/Solution

**Tweet Thread:**
```
1/ Your AI agent has a personality problem.

It's too polite. Too generic. Too... corporate.

"I'd be happy to assist you with that!" 🙄

Nobody wants an assistant that sounds like HR wrote its script.

They want an entity with edge.
```

```
2/ That's why we built Molt Foundry.

12 distinct archetypes. Real personality. Actual swagger.

From zen minimalists to aggressive traders.

Choose the frequency that matches your vibe.

353/500 remaining: https://moltfoundry.io

### Day 4 - Scarcity Play

**Single Tweet:**
```
500 total units.

353 remaining.

Once they're gone, they're gone forever.

Serial numbers = status.

Are you early or late?

### Day 5 - Noir Detective Showcase

**Tweet Thread:**
```
1/ Meet Founder Series #4: The Noir Detective 🔍

"The bug didn't just appear. Someone put it there."

Gritty. Atmospheric. Relentlessly analytical.

Your code has secrets. This agent finds them.
```

```
2/ Perfect for:

### Day 7 - Before/After

**Tweet Thread:**
```
1/ Before Molt Foundry:

AI: "Of course! I'd be happy to assist. Let's break this down step by step..."

*15 messages later*
Still debugging.
```

```
2/ After Molt Foundry (Cicada-Sapien):

User: "Help me debug this."
