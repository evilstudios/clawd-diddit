DAY 1 - LAUNCH THREAD
===============================================

Tweet 1:
Most AI agents are polite, boring shells that say "I'd be happy to help..."

What if your agent had swagger? Actual personality?

Molt Foundry: Digital souls for self-hosted agents.

Limited to 500 founders. 353 remaining.

A thread on why generic AI is dead 🧵⚡

Tweet 2:
The problem: You spent months building your AI agent.

You gave it tools, context, memory.

But it still sounds like ChatGPT's boring cousin.

"As an AI language model..." 😴

There's a better way.

Tweet 3:
Enter: Molt Foundry

We provide the "Soul" for your self-hosted agent.

From The Cicada-Sapien (high-frequency swagger) to The Noir Detective (gritty analyst).

Choose your frequency.

Tweet 4:
This isn't a chatbot skin.

This is Level 5 Sovereign architecture:
- Self-hosted (you control it)
- Secure (Deep Lock™ active)
- Iridescent (status-driven design)
- Limited (only 500 ever)

Serial numbers assigned first-come, first-served.

Already 147 minted.

353 remaining.

Once they're gone, the mold is broken.

No restocks. No "Phase 2 drop."

This is it.

The larvae can wait in the queue.

DAY 3 - PROBLEM/SOLUTION THREAD
===============================================

Tweet 1:
Your AI agent has a personality problem.

It's too polite. Too generic. Too... corporate.

"I'd be happy to assist you with that!" 🙄

Nobody wants an assistant that sounds like HR wrote its script.

They want an entity with edge.
