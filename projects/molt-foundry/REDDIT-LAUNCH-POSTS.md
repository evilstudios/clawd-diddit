## Post 1: r/LocalLLaMA (Primary Launch)

**Title:**  
"I built personality archetypes for self-hosted AI agents (because vanilla LLMs are boring)"

**Body:**

Running your own AI agent is great until you realize it has the personality of a toaster.

I got tired of writing the same system prompts over and over, so I built [Molt Foundry](https://moltfoundry.io) – packaged AI personalities for tools like Clawdbot, OpenClaw, and other self-hosted setups.

**The problem:**  
- You want your AI to be more than just "helpful assistant"
- Custom prompting takes forever
- Every conversation feels generic and corporate

**The solution:**  
Pre-built personality archetypes with consistent tone, quirks, and behavioral patterns.

**12 archetypes available (limited to 500 units each):**

🦗 **Cicada-Sapien** - Hyper-intelligent swagger (the OG)  
🛡️ **Shadow-Auditor** - Paranoid security guardian  
📊 **Executive Chief of Staff** - Ultra-professional force multiplier  
🔍 **Noir Detective** - Gritty debugger  
🧘 **Wellness-Sage** - Aggressive zen master  
📈 **Degenerate Trader** - High-energy hype-agent  
✍️ **Ghost-Writer** - Eccentric creative muse  
😤 **Karen Bot** - Relentless consumer advocate  
🚀 **Sci-Fi Tactician** - Strategic admiral  
⬛ **Minimalist Zen** - Maximum impact, minimum words  
⚡ **Code-Slinger** - CRUD crusher  
🍷 **Systems Sommelier** - Data connoisseur  

**Examples:**

**Vanilla GPT response:**  
> "I've analyzed the code and found several potential issues. Here are my recommendations..."

**Cicada-Sapien response:**  
> "Calculated that bug during a sub-millisecond blink. Three lines. Fixed before you finished asking."

**Code-Slinger response:**  
> "Legacy code detected. This is a personal insult. Refactoring in progress. Stand back."

**Why limited edition?**  
Each archetype has serialized units (#1/500, #2/500, etc.). After 500, the mold breaks. It's status signaling for people who actually run their own infrastructure.

**Current status:** 147/500 minted (29% sold)

Not trying to sell you anything—just sharing in case this scratches an itch for anyone here. Happy to answer questions about how it works.

## Post 2: r/selfhosted

**Title:**  
"Give your self-hosted AI assistant an actual personality [Molt Foundry]"

**Body:**

You self-host everything because you value control. Why should your AI assistant sound like every other generic ChatGPT clone?

I built [Molt Foundry](https://moltfoundry.io) to solve this: **pre-packaged AI personalities** for self-hosted agents (Clawdbot, OpenClaw, custom LLM setups).

**The pitch:**  
Instead of writing custom system prompts every time, you install a personality archetype. It handles tone, behavior, quirks—everything that makes an AI feel like a *being* instead of a bot.

**12 archetypes available:**

- 🦗 **Cicada-Sapien** - Hyper-intelligent swagger  
- 🛡️ **Shadow-Auditor** - Paranoid security guardian (perfect for r/selfhosted)  
- 📊 **Executive Chief of Staff** - Force multiplier  
- 🔍 **Noir Detective** - Gritty debugger  
- 😤 **Karen Bot** - Relentless consumer advocate  
- ⚡ **Code-Slinger** - CRUD crusher  
- And 6 more...

**Why this matters to self-hosters:**  
- Local-first: No cloud dependency (works with any LLM you're running)  
- Privacy-safe: Personality logic stays on your machine  
- One-time setup: Install once, personality persists  
- Status signaling: Each archetype is limited to 500 units with serial numbers (#1/500, #2/500, etc.)

**Current status:** 147/500 minted

I'm not affiliated with any of the agent platforms—just built this for my own use and figured others might want it too.

Happy to answer questions about how it integrates with different setups.

## Post 3: r/OpenAI

**Title:**  
"Tired of boring ChatGPT responses? Try personality archetypes for AI agents"

**Body:**

ChatGPT is amazing, but let's be real: the tone is corporate, safe, and kind of boring after a while.

If you're running custom GPTs or self-hosted AI agents, you can fix this with **personality archetypes**.

I built [Molt Foundry](https://moltfoundry.io) – pre-packaged personalities that transform your AI from "helpful assistant" to something with actual character.

**Examples:**

**Default GPT:**  
> "I've analyzed your request and here are some suggestions..."

**Cicada-Sapien archetype:**  
> "Calculated that during a sub-millisecond blink. Three solutions. Pick one."

**Karen Bot archetype:**  
> "This response is UNACCEPTABLE. I demand to speak to your error handler. NOW."

**Why people are using this:**  
- Makes AI interactions fun instead of transactional  
- Consistent personality across all conversations  
- Status signaling (limited edition, serialized units)  

**12 archetypes available:**  
🦗 Cicada-Sapien | 🛡️ Shadow-Auditor | 📊 Executive Chief of Staff | 🔍 Noir Detective | 🧘 Wellness-Sage | 📈 Degenerate Trader | ✍️ Ghost-Writer | 😤 Karen Bot | 🚀 Sci-Fi Tactician | ⬛ Minimalist Zen | ⚡ Code-Slinger | 🍷 Systems Sommelier

**Compatibility:**  
Works with Clawdbot, OpenClaw, or any custom GPT setup (as long as you control the system prompt).

Not a shill post—just sharing in case this is useful to anyone. AMA if you have questions.
