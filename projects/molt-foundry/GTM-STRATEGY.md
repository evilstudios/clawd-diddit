# Molt Foundry - Go-to-Market Strategy

**Mission:** Sell out Founder Series (353 remaining of 500) and build waitlist for Phase 2

**Current Status:** 147/500 minted (29% sold)

**Target Timeline:** 30-45 days to sellout

---

## Executive Summary

Molt Foundry sells **identity** to self-hosted AI agent users. We're not selling code—we're selling who they want to be. The product has viral DNA: scarcity (500 limited), status (serial numbers), and tribal identity (12 distinct archetypes).

**Revenue Opportunity:**
- Founder Series sellout = validation
- Phase 2 expansion = scale
- Community-driven growth = sustainable

---

## Market Analysis

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Self-hosted AI agent users (OpenClaw, Clawdbot, LocalLLaMA)
- Developers who customize their tools
- Early adopter/tech enthusiast crowd
- Status-conscious buyers (serial numbers = flex)

**Psychographics:**
- Tired of boring, corporate AI responses
- Want personality in their tools
- Value privacy (self-hosted > cloud)
- Community-oriented (Reddit, Discord, Twitter/X)

**Market Size:**
- OpenClaw/Clawdbot users: Growing but niche (~10K users)
- LocalLLaMA community: 500K+ subscribers
- Self-hosted AI enthusiasts: 50-100K active

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competition:** None (first-mover advantage)

**Indirect Competition:**

**Our Advantage:**
1. **Only** product selling packaged AI personalities for self-hosted agents
2. Limited edition creates urgency (500 units)
3. Serial numbers = status signaling
