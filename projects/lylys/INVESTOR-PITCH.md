# LYLYS - Investor Pitch Deck (1-Pager)

**Company:** LoveYouLoveYourShow.com (LYLYS)  
**Founded:** 2026  
**Stage:** Pre-seed / MVP Development  
**Ask:** $100K-$250K seed round (optional - can bootstrap to profitability)

---

## The Problem (TAM: $2B+)

**10 million creators worldwide** have superfans who drive 80% of their revenue, but **zero automation tools** exist to reward loyalty at scale.

**Creator Pain:**
- Can't manually track superfans (same 50 people who comment/donate/subscribe constantly)
- No way to detect milestones (50th comment, 1-year anniversary, $500 donated)
- Sending personalized "thank you" gifts takes 5-10 hours/month
- **Result:** Superfans churn. They feel invisible despite loyalty.

**Market Opportunity:**
- **15,000+ mid-tier creators** (15k-75k subs) on YouTube alone
- **$99-249/mo** willingness to pay (already spending on tools like Patreon, StreamElements)
- **$18M-45M TAM** in YouTube mid-tier alone (before Twitch, Podcasts, TikTok)

---

## The Solution

**LYLYS = Loyalty-as-a-Service for Creators**

Automatically:
1. **Tracks fan behavior** across platforms (YouTube, Twitch, Patreon, Discord)
2. **Detects milestones** (50th comment, 6-month subscriber, $100 donated)
3. **Ships physical rewards** (thank-you cards, stickers, custom merch)
4. **Generates shout-out lists** (fans to recognize in videos)

**Value Prop:** "Set it once, reward fans forever."

**Setup Time:** 5 minutes  
**ROI for Creators:** 5-10 hours/month saved + 20-30% boost in fan retention

---

## Why Now?

**1. Creator Economy Maturation**
- Mid-tier creators (15k-75k subs) are professionalizing
- Spending $200-500/mo on tools already (editing, analytics, monetization)
- Ready to pay for retention tools

**2. Physical > Digital in AI Era**
- Every company uses AI in 2026
- Physical gifts create emotional impact digital can't match
- Unboxing moments = organic social media marketing

**3. Platform API Access**
- YouTube, Twitch, Patreon, Discord all have robust APIs
- Data access is stable (not like early social media)
- Fulfillment infrastructure mature (Printful, Shopify)
