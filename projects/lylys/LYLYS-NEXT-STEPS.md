# LYLYS - Next Steps After YouTube API Test

## What We Learned

**YouTube API Test Results:**
- ✅ API key works
- ✅ Script runs successfully
- ❌ **Found 0 creators in 15k-75k sub range**

**Why:** True Crime niche is polarized:
- Either **mega-channels** (100k+ subs) - too big
- Or **tiny channels** (<5k subs) - too small
- Very few in the "sweet spot"

## Solution: Use Curated Manual List

The `TRUE-CRIME-TARGET-LIST.md` already has high-quality targets. Let's use those instead of automated discovery.

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Start with curated list** (already created)
   - 20+ hand-picked creators
   - Known engagement, quality content
   - Mix of sizes (some slightly above 75k is OK)

2. **Manual research for contacts**
   - Check YouTube "About" pages
   - Look for business emails
   - Check Instagram/Twitter bios
   - Use Hunter.io for website emails

3. **Personalized outreach**
   - Reference specific videos
   - Mention their engagement rates
   - Show you understand their audience

## Alternative: Adjust Range

If you want automated discovery:

### Option A: Widen Range to 10k-100k
- More results
- Some will be on the larger side
- Still manageable for 1-on-1 service

### Option B: Focus on "Rising Stars" (5k-20k)
- Smaller but growing channels
- More likely to say yes
- Can grow with them

### Option C: Multi-Niche Strategy
- Not just True Crime
- Add: Mystery, Unsolved, Paranormal, Horror
- Broader pool = more qualified creators

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Manual Curated Outreach (This Week)
1. Use existing `TRUE-CRIME-TARGET-LIST.md`
2. Research 10-15 top targets
3. Find business emails manually
4. Send highly personalized pitches
5. **Goal:** 1-2 pilot customers

### Phase 2: Expand Search (Next Month)
If Phase 1 works:
1. Adjust YouTube script range to 10k-100k
2. Add related niches (mystery, paranormal)
3. Automated discovery for next batch
4. **Goal:** 5-10 customers

## Why Manual > Automated for LYLYS

**LYLYS is high-touch service:**
- $99-249/month per creator
- Needs personalization and relationship
- Quality > quantity

**Better to:**
- Reach 10 perfect-fit creators (manual)
- Than 100 mediocre leads (automated)

**The curated list is actually better** than automated discovery for this use case.

## Files to Use

**Outreach:**
- `OUTREACH-TEMPLATES.md` - Email sequences
- `TRUE-CRIME-TARGET-LIST.md` - Curated creators

**Tools (if needed later):**
- `youtube-creator-finder.py` - Adjust range
- Instantly V2 automation - For scaled outreach

---

**Status:** YouTube API works. Automated discovery found no results in target range. **Recommendation: Use manual curated list for higher-quality, personalized outreach.**
