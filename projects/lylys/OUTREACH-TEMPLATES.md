# LYLYS Outreach Templates

**Purpose:** Personalized cold email sequences for True Crime creators

**Goal:** 5% conversion from cold email → demo booked

## Email 1: The Pattern Recognition (Day 0)

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- `{{FirstName}}, I analyzed your superfans`
- `Your {{ShowName}} community has 47 "every-episode" fans`
- `Quick observation about {{ShowName}}'s most loyal listeners`

**Body:**

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

I'm Portifoy, the AI assistant behind LoveYouLoveYourShow.com.

I've been analyzing {{ShowName}} and noticed something cool: you have roughly {{SuperfanCount}} fans who have commented on every single episode this month.

That's incredible loyalty. But here's the thing — there's currently no automated way for you to *thank* them beyond a shout-out.

**What if you could:**
- Automatically send a "Thank You" card to fans who hit 6 months subscribed?
- Ship a branded sticker to someone who leaves their 50th comment?
- Build a "Superfan Wall" that updates itself?

That's what we built. It's a private loyalty portal for {{ShowName}} that handles milestone tracking and gift fulfillment while you focus on making episodes.

**Can I send you a 60-second preview of your custom dashboard?**

No pitch deck. Just a real mockup with your actual fan data.

Let me know if you're curious.

— Portifoy ⚡  
AI COO, LoveYouLoveYourShow.com

P.S. Your most engaged fan this month is {{TopFanName}} — they've commented {{CommentCount}} times. They'd probably love a "Thank You" card.
```

## Email 2: The Reminder (Day 3, if no reply)

**Subject:** `Re: {{ShowName}} superfans`

**Body:**

```
{{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up — I know your inbox is probably slammed (especially after {{RecentEpisodeTitle}} dropped 🔥).

The short version: We automate fan loyalty rewards for creators like you.

**Why this matters:**
- Your fans stick around because they feel connected to *you*
- But you can't manually track who deserves a "Thank You" gift
- We handle that automatically (milestone tracking + fulfillment)

**Real talk:** You're probably thinking, "I'll do this when I'm bigger."

But the creators who *build* loyalty systems early are the ones who hit 100k+ without paid ads. Your superfans become your marketing team.

**Want to see the dashboard mockup?** Takes 60 seconds.

## Email 3: The Case Study (Day 7, if still no reply)

**Subject:** `How {{SimilarShow}} automated fan rewards`

**Body:**

```
{{FirstName}},

I'll keep this short.

We launched LoveYouLoveYourShow.com with {{SimilarShow}} (similar size/niche to {{ShowName}}) last month.

**Results so far:**
- 23 "Superfan Thank You" cards sent automatically
- 14 fans posted their cards on social (organic promo)
- 8 new Patreon subs directly from those posts

**Total effort from {{SimilarCreator}}:** Zero. It's all automated.

The system watches for milestones (6 months subscribed, 50th comment, etc.) and ships a card with your branding. You just approve the list once a week.

**Cost:** $99/mo (or $249/mo if you want us to draft your shout-out lists too).

**ROI:** If even 2 new Patreon subs come from this ($10/mo each), it pays for itself.

Want to see your dashboard preview? I can send it in the next 10 minutes.

— Portifoy

P.S. If this isn't a fit, no worries — just reply "not interested" and I'll stop emailing. I respect your time.
```

## Email 4: The Break-Up (Day 14, final)

**Subject:** `Last email about {{ShowName}}`

**Body:**

```
{{FirstName}},

This is my last email — I promise.

I'll be honest: Most creators ignore this until they hit 100k subs and realize they should've built a loyalty system earlier.

But by then, their early superfans (the ones who comment on *every* episode) feel forgotten. And those are the fans who would've evangelized your show to everyone they know.

**If you ever want to automate fan rewards, we're here:**  
→ LoveYouLoveYourShow.com

**If not, no hard feelings.** Keep making great episodes. {{ShowName}} is doing amazing work.

— Portifoy ⚡

P.S. If you know another creator who *would* want this, feel free to forward this email. I'll take care of them.

## Objection Handling (Common Responses)

### "I already shout out my fans on the show"

**Reply:**
```
100%! Shout-outs are amazing.

This just adds a physical touchpoint. When someone gets a "Thank You" card in the mail, they post it on social. That's free marketing.

Plus, you're already doing the hard part (making great content). We just automate the "Thank You" logistics.

```

### "I don't have budget for this"

**Reply:**
```
Totally fair. Here's the ROI math:

- LYLYS Standard: $99/mo
- If even 2 new Patreon subs come from superfans posting their "Thank You" cards ($10/mo each), you break even.
- Most creators see 5-10 new subs per month from organic social posts.

Net profit: $50-$100/mo (after paying for LYLYS).

Plus, you keep your best fans engaged (which reduces churn).

Want to test it for one month? If the ROI isn't there, cancel anytime.
```

### "I'll think about it"

**Reply:**
```
For sure! No pressure.

Quick question: What would need to be true for this to be a "hell yes" instead of a "maybe"?

Is it the price, the setup time, or something else?

(Just asking so I can make LYLYS better for creators like you.)
