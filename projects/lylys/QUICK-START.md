## 💡 Why This Works

**Problem:** Creators have superfans but no way to reward them automatically

**Solution:** We track milestones (6 months subscribed, 50th comment) and ship "Thank You" cards automatically

**Why they'll pay $99-249/mo:**
- Saves 5-10 hours/month (manual tracking)
- Generates 5-10 new Patreon subs/mo (organic social posts)
- ROI: $50-100/mo profit after paying us

**Why True Crime first:**
- Highest engagement niche on YouTube
- Strong community culture (binge-watchers, super-commenters)
- Proven monetization (Patreon, merch)

---

## 🎯 First Milestone

**Goal:** First paying customer within 30 days

**Path:**
1. Generate 100 leads (Week 1)
2. Send 70 emails (Week 1-2)
3. Book 3-5 demos (Week 2-3)
4. Close 1-2 customers (Week 3-4)

**Revenue:** $99-498 MRR (1-2 customers)
