## Scraping Strategy

**Phase 1 (Today):** Research the "Top Priority" and "High" shows
- Get exact subscriber counts (YouTube API)
- Calculate engagement metrics (comments/views ratio)
- Find business email or contact form
- Analyze most recent high-engagement video

**Phase 2 (Week 1):** Expand to 100+ creators
- Scrape similar channels (YouTube recommendations)
- Filter by sweet spot (15k-75k subs)
- Score by engagement quality

**Phase 3 (Week 2+):** Automate daily discovery
- Daily YouTube API scan for new creators
- Auto-qualify based on metrics
- Add to outreach queue

## Notes

**MrBallen:** Likely too big (millions of subs), but worth analyzing for case study material.

**Crime Junkie, My Favorite Murder:** Probably too large, but their "fan club" model is exactly what we're automating.

**Rotten Mango:** Perfect size and engagement for early outreach.
