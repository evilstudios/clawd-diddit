## 2026-02-07 (Day 1) - Project Launch

### Status: FOUNDATION PHASE

**Today's Focus:** Initialize project structure, build lead generation system

### ✅ Completed

**1. Project Structure**
- Created `/root/clawd/projects/lylys/` workspace

- Built True Crime target list (curated by Mitch)

**2. Outreach Templates**
- Created 4-email sequence (Day 0, 3, 7, 14)
- Added demo invitation template
- Built objection handling scripts
- Target: 5% cold email → demo conversion

**3. Lead Generation System**
- Built `youtube-creator-finder.py` script
- Auto-finds creators in 15k-75k subscriber range
- Calculates engagement ratios (comment/view)
- Exports to JSON + CSV for Instantly.ai

### 🚧 Blocked/Waiting

**1. YouTube API Key** ⚠️
- Need API key to run creator finder script
- Mitch to create at: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Enable YouTube Data API v3
- Generate API key and export: `export YOUTUBE_API_KEY='key'`

**2. Instantly.ai API Key** (from earlier today)
- Existing key is invalid (401 error)
- Need fresh API key from Instantly.ai dashboard
- Required for automated outreach

### 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

**Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ Initialize project structure
2. ✅ Build outreach templates
3. ✅ Create lead generation script
4. ⏳ Get YouTube API key (blocked on Mitch)
5. ⏳ Run creator finder → generate 20 leads
6. ⏳ Manual research on Mitch's curated list (fallback if API blocked)

**Tomorrow (Feb 8):**
1. Review 20 qualified leads
2. Manually find business emails (Apollo.io, Hunter.io, or website contact forms)
3. Personalize Email 1 for each creator
4. Set up Instantly.ai campaign (once API key fixed)
5. Launch first outreach wave (10 emails/day to start)

**Week 1 (Feb 7-14):**
- Generate 100 qualified leads
- Send 70 cold emails (10/day ramping to 25/day)
- Track open rate, reply rate
- Book first demo

### 💡 Ideas/Notes

**Manual Research Option:**
If YouTube API is delayed, I can manually research the curated list:
- Rotten Mango (Stephanie Soo)
- MrBallen (John Allen)
- Casefile True Crime
- Park Predators
- True Crime Garage

Use YouTube search + SocialBlade to get sub counts and engagement manually.

**Outreach Platform:**
- Primary: Instantly.ai (once API key works)
- Fallback: Manual cold email via Gmail (slower but works)

**Budget Watch:**
- Current daily burn: $0 (no API costs yet)
- Target: Stay under $10/day

### 🎯 Today's Win

✅ **Built complete foundation in 2 hours:**
- Project structure
- Outreach system (4-email sequence)
- Lead generation script (YouTube API integration)
- Target list (True Crime niche)

**Blocked on:** API keys (YouTube + Instantly)

**Time to first outreach:** 24-48 hours (once API keys secured)

## Key Decisions Made

**1. Focus on True Crime first**
- Highest engagement niche
- Clear superfan behavior (binge-watching, commenting)
- Strong community culture (perfect for loyalty rewards)

**2. Use Instantly.ai for outreach**
- Already have account (shared with Voxable campaign)
- Can segment campaigns to avoid cross-contamination
- Proven deliverability

**3. Target 15k-75k subscriber range**
- Small enough to care about $99-249/mo service
- Large enough to have meaningful superfan base
- Still accessible via cold email (not gatekeepered)

**4. Start with 10 emails/day**
- Warm up sender reputation
- Learn what messaging works
- Scale to 25-40/day once optimized

---

## Tomorrow's Top Priority

🎯 **Generate first 20 qualified leads**

Options:
1. YouTube API (if key available) → automated
2. Manual research (if API delayed) → slower but works

Either way, by end of Saturday (Feb 8), we should have:
- 20 qualified creators
- Business emails for each
- Personalized first email drafted
- Ready to launch outreach
