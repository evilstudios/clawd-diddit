## Research Process

### Phase 1: Google Maps Scraping (2 hours)

**Searches:**
1. "bakery Philadelphia"
2. "cafe Philadelphia"  
3. "breakfast restaurant Philadelphia"
4. "sandwich shop Philadelphia"
5. "bagel shop Philadelphia"

**For each result, collect:**
- Restaurant name
- Address
- Phone number
- Website (if listed)
- Rating + review count
- Hours (verify they're open)

**Target:** 70-80 raw leads (filter down to 50 best)

---

### Phase 2: Email Finding (2 hours)

**For each restaurant:**

1. **Check website** (if they have one)
   - Contact page
   - About page
   - Footer
   - Look for: info@, contact@, hello@, orders@

2. **Check social media**
   - Instagram bio
   - Facebook page info
   - Twitter bio

3. **Pattern guessing** (if no email found)
   - Extract domain from website
   - Try: info@domain, contact@domain, hello@domain

4. **Manual verification**
   - Does email look legitimate?
   - Business domain (not Gmail)?
   - Still active?

**Target:** 60%+ email coverage (30-40 emails)

---

### Phase 3: Quality Filter (30 min)

**Remove:**
- Obvious chains
- Closed businesses
- Duplicates
- Poor fit (fine dining, etc.)

**Prioritize:**
- High ratings (4+ stars)
- High review count (shows activity)
- Strong waste indicators (bakery, fresh prep daily)
- Found business email (ready to contact)

**Final list:** 50 high-quality leads

---

### Phase 4: Export & Format (30 min)

**CSV Columns:**
```csv
Restaurant Name,Email,Phone,Address,Website,Category,Rating,Reviews,Notes
```

**Add personalization notes:**
- Type of food (for targeting)
- Notable menu items (for personalization)
- Unique selling points
- Best contact method

**Output file:** `philly-ready.csv`

---

## Backup Plan

**If manual takes too long:**
- Deliver 30-40 highest quality leads
- Quality > quantity
- Better to have 30 perfect fits than 50 mediocre

**If email finding is slow:**
- Prioritize businesses with websites
- Use Hunter.io for batch verification
- Accept 50% email coverage if quality is high
