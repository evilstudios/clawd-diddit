# Afoodable - Restaurant Cold Email Sequences

## Campaign Strategy

**Hook:** Food waste = lost money (emotional + financial)
**Angle:** Simple question → value prop → low-friction signup
**Tone:** Helpful, not salesy. Sustainability-conscious but profit-focused.

---

## SEQUENCE A: The "End-of-Day" Hook (Recommended)

### Email 1 (Day 1): The Question
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Quick question about {{RestaurantName}}'s end-of-day food"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, what happens to your unsold food?"
- C: "Do you throw away food at {{RestaurantName}}?"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question:

What happens to the food you can't sell at the end of the day?

Most restaurants throw it away—which means you're paying twice: once to make it, and again to dispose of it.

We built Afoodable to help restaurants like {{RestaurantName}} turn that waste into revenue instead.

Think of it as a marketplace for surplus food—local buyers find your end-of-day inventory, you recover money from items you'd otherwise toss.

**One pilot bakery recovered ~$1,200/month** from items they used to throw away.

Would it make sense to chat for 5 minutes about how this could work for {{RestaurantName}}?

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** We only make money when you recover money. Zero upfront cost.

### Email 2 (Day 3): The Reality Check
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "The real cost of throwing away food at {{RestaurantName}}"
- B: "{{FirstName}}, following up on food waste → revenue"
- C: "Most restaurants lose $800-2K/month this way"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

Following up on my last note.

Here's the math most restaurant owners don't want to think about:

If you throw away even **$50 worth of food per day**, that's:
- $350/week
- **$1,500/month**
- **$18,000/year**

Gone. Just... gone.

Afoodable helps you recover that revenue by:

✅ **Listing surplus items** (end-of-day, overproduction, near-expiry)  
✅ **Connecting with local buyers** (consumers, nonprofits, resellers)  
✅ **Handling ordering & pickup** (no manual coordination)  
✅ **Reporting waste reduction** (ESG, sustainability goals)

**You're already making the food.** Why not get paid for it?

Are you open to a quick 5-minute call to see if this fits {{RestaurantName}}?

Best,
[Your Name]

**[Book a time]** or just reply with a good day this week.

### Email 3 (Day 7): The Breakup (Low-Pressure Exit)
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Should I take {{RestaurantName}} off my list?"
- B: "Last check-in, {{FirstName}}"
- C: "Closing the loop on food waste → revenue"

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing that turning end-of-day waste into revenue isn't a priority for {{RestaurantName}} right now.

I'll take you off my follow-up list so I don't clutter your inbox.

But if you ever decide you're tired of watching food (and money) go into the trash, feel free to reach out anytime.

Wishing you the best with {{RestaurantName}}.

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** We're still in early rollout mode, so spots are limited. If you change your mind, just reply.

---

## OPTIONAL: Extended Sequence (Days 10-14)

### Email 4 (Day 10): The Sustainability Angle
**Subject:** {{FirstName}}, your customers care about this

Hi {{FirstName}},

One more angle worth mentioning:

Your customers are asking about sustainability. They want to know their favorite restaurants care about food waste.

Afoodable helps you:
- **Reduce waste** (measurable impact)
- **Increase revenue** (recover losses)
- **Market your efforts** (ESG, social good)

It's a win-win-win: better margins, better brand, better planet.

Still thinking about this for {{RestaurantName}}?

**[Book a 5-min call]** or reply with a question.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 5 (Day 14): The Final Value Bomb
**Subject:** The $18K/year you're leaving on the table

Hi {{FirstName}},

Last email, I promise.

If {{RestaurantName}} throws away just **$50/day** in unsold food, that's:

→ **$18,000/year** in lost revenue  
→ Plus disposal costs  
→ Plus environmental impact

Afoodable helps you recover that money with:
- Zero upfront cost
- 10-20% commission (only when you make a sale)
- Simple listing & pickup system

**One bakery recovered $1,200/month.** That's $14,400/year from food they used to throw away.

If this isn't for you right now, no problem. But if you're leaving money in the trash... this is the fix.

**[Book a call]** or just reply with "Tell me more."

Best,
[Your Name]

## Response Handling Templates

### When they reply "Tell me more":

2. **Quick demo:** I can send a 2-min video walkthrough

Which works better for you?"

---

### When they ask about pricing:
"Good question! Pricing is simple:

**Option 1:** 10-20% commission per sale (zero upfront cost)  
**Option 2:** $49-149/month + 5-10% commission (lower transaction fee)

Most restaurants start with Option 1 since there's no risk—you only pay when you recover money.

Either way, best of luck with {{RestaurantName}}!"
