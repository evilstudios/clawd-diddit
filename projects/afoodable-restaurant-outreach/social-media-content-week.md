## Monday: Stat Shock

### Facebook/LinkedIn (Text + Image)
**Copy:**
"💰 The average restaurant throws away $25,000-$75,000 worth of food every year.

That's not waste. That's lost revenue.

What if you could recover even 20% of it? That's $5,000-$15,000 back in your pocket.

Afoodable helps restaurants turn end-of-day surplus into revenue—automatically.

No upfront costs. We only make money when you do.

## Wednesday: Case Study Highlight

### Twitter/X Thread (4 tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
"A Portland bakery was throwing away 30-50 bagels every single day.

Now? Zero waste by closing time. And $850/month in recovered revenue.

Here's what they did: 🧵"

**Tweet 2:**
"They listed their end-of-day surplus on @Afoodable at 60% off.

Pickup window: 7-9pm.

Customers get great deals. The bakery recovers money they would've lost. Win-win."

**Tweet 3:**
"The setup took 5 minutes.

Now it runs automatically:
- List surplus at 6:30pm
- Customers order via app
- Pickup at close
- Money in the bank

No extra work. Just recovered revenue."

**Tweet 4:**
"$850/month × 12 = $10,200/year recovered from what was garbage.

That's the power of smart food waste management.

## Thursday: Quick Tip

### Facebook Post (Short + Actionable)
**Copy:**
"🔥 RESTAURANT TIP: Your end-of-day 'waste' isn't waste—it's inventory you can still sell.

3 ways to recover revenue TODAY:

1️⃣ Offer flash discounts 1 hour before close (50-60% off)
2️⃣ Text your loyalty members with last-minute deals
3️⃣ List on platforms like Afoodable (automated, zero effort)

Even recovering $500/month = $6,000/year. That's a new piece of equipment or an extra staff member.

Stop throwing money away. Start recovering it.

## Saturday: Behind the Scenes / Human Story

### LinkedIn (Thought Leadership)
**Copy:**
"I spoke with a bakery owner in Portland last week who said something that stuck with me:

'Every night I'd throw away 40 bagels. It broke my heart. But I didn't know what else to do.'

This is the reality for thousands of restaurant owners. They care about sustainability. They hate the waste. But they're stuck between economics and ethics.

Here's what changed for her:

She listed her end-of-day bagels on Afoodable at 60% off. Customers could order between 7-9pm. Pickup was seamless.

Now? Zero waste. $850/month recovered. And her customers love the deals.

The solution wasn't complicated. It just needed to exist.

That's why we built Afoodable—to give restaurant owners a simple, automated way to turn surplus into revenue.

If you're in food service and dealing with end-of-day waste, let's talk. We might be able to help.
