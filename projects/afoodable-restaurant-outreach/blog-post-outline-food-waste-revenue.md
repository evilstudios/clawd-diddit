## Outline

### Hook (First 100 words)
**Stat bomb opening:**
"Every day, the average restaurant throws away $2,000-4,000 worth of perfectly good food. That's $60,000-120,000 per year—literally in the trash. But what if that waste could become revenue instead?"

**Transition:** "A growing number of restaurants are discovering they don't have to choose between sustainability and profitability. Here's how they're doing it."

### Section 1: The Hidden Cost of Restaurant Food Waste

**Subheadings:**
- **The Real Numbers:** What Most Restaurants Waste
- **It's Not Just the Food:** Labor, utilities, and opportunity cost
- **Why Traditional Approaches Fail** (donations are great but don't solve the economics)

**Key Stats to Include:**
- 4-10% of food purchased by restaurants is wasted (USDA)
- Average restaurant wastes $25,000-75,000/year in food costs alone
- 50% comes from prep waste, 30% from overproduction, 20% from plate waste

**Emotional Hook:**
"You're paying staff to prepare food, paying for ingredients, paying for utilities to cook it... then paying to throw it away."

### Section 2: The 3 Types of Recoverable Food Waste

**1. End-of-Day Surplus**
- Baked goods (bagels, pastries, bread)
- Prepared meals (sandwiches, salads)
- Hot bar items (soups, sides)

**Why it's recoverable:** Still fresh, still sellable at discount

**2. Overproduction from Events/Catering**
- Catering overages (20% surplus is standard)
- Private event leftovers
- Banquet prep mistakes

**Why it's recoverable:** High-value items, bulk quantities

**3. "Ugly" or Cosmetically Imperfect Items**
- Broken cookies
- Irregular produce
- Off-spec portions

**Why it's recoverable:** Taste/safety intact, just not "pretty"

### Section 3: How Smart Restaurants Are Recovering Revenue

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Pricing + Last-Minute Deals**
- Flash sales 1-2 hours before close
- "Too Good To Go" model (50-70% discounts)
- Mobile alerts to nearby customers

**Example:** "A Denver bakery now sells out daily by offering 60% off after 7pm—recovering $800/month that would've gone to waste."

**Strategy 2: B2B Surplus Redistribution**
- Sell to meal prep companies
- Partner with corporate cafeterias
- Supply nonprofits (paid arrangements, not donations)

**Example:** "A ghost kitchen sells overproduction to a local meal-prep service for 40% wholesale—turning waste into predictable revenue."

**Strategy 3: Technology Platforms**
- Afoodable, Too Good To Go, Flashfood
- Automated listing + distribution
- Real-time inventory management

**Example:** "One fast-casual chain recovered $1,200/location/month using automated surplus distribution."
