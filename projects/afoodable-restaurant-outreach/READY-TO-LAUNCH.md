3. Collect 50 restaurant contacts
4. Verify emails (neverbounce.com)
5. Format as CSV

**Option B: Automated (I build scraper)**
- 3 hours build time
- 100+ leads per city
- Fully automated
- Exports ready-to-use CSV

### Afternoon: Launch Campaign (30 min)

```bash
export INSTANTLY_API_KEY="your_fresh_key"

./automation/instantly-campaign-launcher.py \
  --leads afoodable-restaurants.csv \
  --campaign-name "Afoodable - Restaurants - Feb 2025"
```

Then configure sequences in Instantly dashboard (copy from email-sequences.md)

## Decision Points

### 1. Launch City
**Recommendation:** Austin, TX or Portland, OR
- Food-forward culture
- Sustainability-conscious
- Lots of independents
- Good for word-of-mouth

### 2. Lead List Size
**Recommendation:** Start with 50-100
- Test sequences
- Optimize based on data
- Scale after validation

### 3. Sequence Length
**Recommendation:** 3 emails (conservative)
- Email 1 (Day 1) - The Question
- Email 2 (Day 3) - The Math  
- Email 3 (Day 7) - Breakup

Add more later if needed.

### 4. Lead Sourcing Method
**Recommendation:** Manual for first 50
- Fast (2 hours)
- Validates concept
- Cheap

Build scraper if it works.

## Expected Results (50 Restaurants)

### Good Performance:
- Open rate: 40-50%
- Reply rate: 10-15%
- Interested: 5-8 restaurants
- Signups: 2-3 restaurants

### Great Performance:
- Open rate: 50-60%+
- Reply rate: 15-20%
- Interested: 8-10 restaurants
- Signups: 4-6 restaurants

**Note:** Restaurants typically respond better than B2B (local, owner-operated, tangible ROI)

## What I Need From You

1. **Instantly.ai API key** (fresh, working one)
2. **Launch city** (which city should we target first?)
3. **Lead list preference:**
   - Manual build (I can guide you)
   - Automated scraper (I build it)
   - Purchase list (you buy it)

Once I have those, we're live in <30 minutes.

## Automated Scraper Option

If you want, I can build:

**Google Maps Restaurant Scraper**
- Searches: "Bakery [city]", "Cafe [city]", "Fast casual [city]"
- Extracts: Name, phone, email, address, hours, reviews
- Verifies: Email validation built-in
- Scores: Flags high-potential leads
- Exports: CSV ready for Instantly.ai

**Build time:** 3 hours
**Output:** 100+ verified leads per city

Want it? Say the word.
