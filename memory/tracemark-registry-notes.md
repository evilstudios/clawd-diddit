## Priority Placement Decision Factors

2. Revenue model? (Subscription, per-authentication fee, transaction %)
3. Target customer? (Collectors? Dealers? Auction houses?)
4. Unique angle vs. existing authentication services?
5. How was this positioned when vibecoded?

## Market Size & Revenue Potential

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
