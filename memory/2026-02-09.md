### ✅ Evil Apples - Revenue Monitoring System
Built automated revenue monitoring with anomaly detection:

**Features:**
- Fetches daily AppLovin revenue metrics (revenue, impressions, eCPM)
- 7-day trend analysis
- Anomaly detection (revenue drops >30%, impression drops >40%, eCPM drops >25%)
- Daily snapshots saved to JSON
- Formatted reports with emoji indicators

**Files:**
- `projects/evil-apples/applovin-revenue-monitor.py` - Main monitoring script
- `projects/evil-apples/README.md` - Documentation
- `projects/evil-apples/revenue-data/` - Daily snapshots

**Integration:**
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md for Monday/Thursday checks
- Currently shows "no data" (normal for pre-production app)
- Will automatically alert when revenue/metrics drop

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 projects/evil-apples/applovin-revenue-monitor.py
```

### ✅ Evil Apples - Google Play Console Access (In Progress)
Set up Google Play monitoring:

**Completed:**
- Created service account: evil-apples-play-monitor@banded-torus-733.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Generated JSON key and secured
- Enabled Google Play Android Developer API (projects 888984190835 & banded-torus-733)
- Granted Editor permissions in Play Console
- Built monitoring script: `google-play-monitor.py`

**Status:**
- ⏳ Permissions propagating (5-60 minutes typical)
- Script ready to pull reviews, ratings, download stats
- Package name confirmed: com.evilapples.app

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for permissions to propagate
- Test google-play-monitor.py
- Possibly need to grant access via Settings → API Access (alternative route)

**Files:**

- `projects/evil-apples/GOOGLE-PLAY-CREDENTIALS.md` - Documentation

## Heartbeat Activities

### 2:25 PM EST - Facebook Auto-Post Attempt
- ❌ Failed: Page token expired (needs refresh)

- Action needed: Mitch to refresh Facebook token when available

## Pending
- Molt Foundry production readiness
- LYLYS background work
- Facebook token refresh
- Google Play permissions verification (retry in 30-60 min)

## Notes
- Evil Apples currently has no revenue data (expected - app likely in development)
- Monitoring systems ready to track once monetization is active
- All credentials secured and documented
- Mitch appreciated the productivity: "You are such a big help" ⚡
