---

## Diaflow Integration Breakdown

### #1: API Testing ✅
**What I Did:**
- Tested Diaflow API endpoints
- Discovered it's a React SPA (no direct REST API)
- Determined webhook-based execution is the approach
- Built test script to explore capabilities

**File:** `automation/diaflow-test.py`

### #2: Hybrid Approach Client ✅
**What I Built:**
- Python wrapper class (`DiaflowClient`)
- Workflow registration system
- Trigger/response handling
- Example wrappers for lead scraping, data processing

**Features:**
- Register workflows with webhook URLs
- Trigger workflows with data payloads
- Handle responses and errors
- Easy integration into existing automation

**File:** `automation/diaflow-client.py`

**Usage:**
```python
from automation.diaflow_client import DiaflowClient, LeadScraperWorkflow

client = DiaflowClient()
client.register_workflow("restaurant-scraper", "WEBHOOK_URL")

scraper = LeadScraperWorkflow(client)
leads = scraper.scrape_restaurants(city="Austin", business_type="bakery", limit=50)
```

### #3: Specific Use Cases ✅
**What I Documented:**
- 7 detailed use case templates
- Diaflow vs Portifoy decision matrix
- Hybrid workflow patterns
- Getting started guide

**Use Cases:**
1. **Afoodable Lead Generation** - Restaurant scraping pipeline
2. **Voxable Service Leads** - Multi-city service business scraping
3. **Evil Apples Analytics** - Multi-source daily dashboard
4. **Content Pipeline** - AI content generation + social posting
5. **Competitor Monitoring** - Weekly competitor intelligence
6. **Feedback Analysis** - Aggregate reviews/tickets, sentiment analysis
7. **Receipt Processing** - OCR + expense categorization

**Files:**
- `automation/DIAFLOW-INTEGRATION.md` - Strategy & architecture
- `automation/DIAFLOW-USE-CASES.md` - 7 detailed use cases

## Diaflow Strategy Summary

### When to Use Diaflow:
- ✅ Complex multi-page web scraping
- ✅ Scheduled automation (runs without me)
- ✅ OCR/document processing
- ✅ Visual workflow documentation
- ✅ Parallel execution (many tasks simultaneously)
- ✅ Repeatable production pipelines

### When to Use Portifoy (Me):
- ✅ Git commits & repo management
- ✅ Quick iterations & testing
- ✅ Decision-making & strategy
- ✅ Complex orchestration across tools
- ✅ Real-time conversation & pivots
- ✅ Contextual analysis

### Hybrid Approach (Best):
1. **Portifoy decides** what needs doing (strategy)
2. **Portifoy triggers** Diaflow workflow (delegation)
3. **Diaflow processes** data (heavy lifting)
4. **Diaflow returns** results
5. **Portifoy analyzes** & takes action (context)
6. **Portifoy commits** to repo (persistence)
7. **Portifoy reports** to Mitch (communication)

---

## Next Steps for Diaflow

### For Mitch:
1. **Create test workflow in Diaflow UI**
   - Login: https://atlantica.diaflow.app/dashboard
   - Add HTTP Trigger node
   - Add simple processing
   - Publish & share webhook URL

2. **Pick first production workflow:**
   - Restaurant lead scraper (Afoodable)?
   - Service business scraper (Voxable)?
   - Daily analytics aggregator (Evil Apples)?

### For Portifoy:
1. **Test with webhook URL** once Mitch creates workflow
2. **Build first integration** (probably lead scraper)
3. **Monitor credit usage** and optimize
