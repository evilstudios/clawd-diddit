### ✅ Evil Apples - Revenue Monitoring System
Built automated revenue monitoring with anomaly detection:

**Features:**
- Fetches daily AppLovin revenue metrics (revenue, impressions, eCPM)
- 7-day trend analysis
- Anomaly detection (revenue drops >30%, impression drops >40%, eCPM drops >25%)
- Daily snapshots saved to JSON
- Formatted reports with emoji indicators

**Files:**
- `projects/evil-apples/applovin-revenue-monitor.py` - Main monitoring script
- `projects/evil-apples/README.md` - Documentation
- `projects/evil-apples/revenue-data/` - Daily snapshots

**Integration:**
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md for Monday/Thursday checks
- Currently shows "no data" (normal for pre-production app)
- Will automatically alert when revenue/metrics drop

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 projects/evil-apples/applovin-revenue-monitor.py
```

## Pending
- Molt Foundry production readiness
- LYLYS background work

## Notes
- Evil Apples currently has no revenue data (expected - app likely in development)
- Monitoring system ready to track once monetization is active
- All credentials secured and documented
