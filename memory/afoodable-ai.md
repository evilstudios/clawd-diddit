# Afoodable AI - Product Details

## Product Overview
**Afoodable** - Turn restaurant food waste into revenue

**Elevator Pitch:** "DoorDash for food that would've been thrown away — optimized for margins, timing, and sustainability."

**What It Does:**
- Lets restaurants list surplus/end-of-day food
- Distributes listings to local consumers, nonprofits, resale buyers
- Handles discovery, ordering, pickup windows
- Provides waste reduction & revenue recovery reporting

## Target Market (ICP)

**Sweet Spot:**
- Fast casual restaurants
- Bakeries / cafés
- Prepared-meal kitchens
- Ghost kitchens
- Small regional chains (3-50 locations)

**Why These Work:**
- Predictable surplus
- Lower operational friction
- Care about margins + sustainability
- Faster decision cycles

**Less Ideal (for now):**
- Fine dining (less surplus, brand concerns)
- Massive chains (long sales cycles)

## Pricing Model

**Recommended: Transaction-based (easiest sell)**
- 10-20% commission per recovered sale
- No upfront cost (low friction)

**Alternative: SaaS + lower commission**
- $49-149/month per location
- 5-10% transaction fee

**Key Message:** "We only make money when you recover money."

## Pain Points Solved
