## Manus.im Integration - COMPLETED ⚡

**Date:** 2026-02-13 05:15 UTC  
**Status:** Fully operational

### What I Built

Integrated Manus AI as a specialized task executor for complex workflows that need:
- Browser automation with anti-bot bypass (LinkedIn, Similarweb)
- Deep research capabilities
- Isolated Linux sandbox execution
- Multi-step autonomous task workflows

### Architecture

```
Portifoy (Manager/Router) → Manus (Specialist Executor) → Results → Portifoy (Delivery)
```

**Division of labor:**
- **Portifoy (me):** Local context, memory, proactive monitoring, routing, integration
- **Manus:** Heavy browser automation, deep research, sandbox execution

### Deliverables

1. **Python Client** (`skills/manus/manus_client.py`)
   - Clean API wrapper
   - Sync and async task creation
   - Result extraction helpers
   - Polling and wait functionality

2. **Documentation** (`skills/manus/README.md`)
   - Complete setup guide
   - Integration points for all Mitch's businesses
   - Cost management tips
   - Security best practices

3. **Examples** (`skills/manus/examples.py`)
   - Lead generation workflows
   - Competitive intelligence gathering
   - Data processing
   - Batch task creation

4. **Configuration** (`.env.manus`)
   - Secure API key storage
   - Ready to source into environment

### Use Cases Ready to Deploy

1. **BigHouse 3PL** - "Find 50 cold storage facilities in PA"
2. **Evil Apples** - Daily competitor monitoring on app stores
3. **MoltFoundry** - Deep background research on new users
4. **General** - LinkedIn scraping, market research, data gathering

### Technical Notes

- API Base: `https://api.manus.ai/v1`
- Auth: Custom `API_KEY` header
- Agent profiles: `manus-1.6` (default), `manus-1.6-lite` (fast), `manus-1.6-max` (powerful)
- Credit-based pricing, track via `credit_usage` field
- Tasks are async by default, can poll or set webhooks

### Test Results

✅ Connection successful  
✅ Task creation working  
✅ Result extraction working  
✅ Client tested and functional  

### Next Steps

- Test real workflows (lead gen, competitive intel)
- Configure LinkedIn/Similarweb connectors in Manus web app
- Build higher-level orchestration wrappers
- Monitor credit usage and optimize

**Status:** Ready for production use. Mitch now has access to industrial-grade browser automation and research capabilities. ⚡
