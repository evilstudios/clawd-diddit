## Evil Apples – Game Center login fix
- Root cause: iOS Game Center deprecated API sometimes returns empty string IDs; server accepted/saved empty `gc_id`, breaking login lookup.
- Fix implemented in evilapplesserver branch `fix/game-center-ios-auth` (commit `6fac737d`):
  - Reject empty string gc_id in login lookup (User.checkExistingUser)
  - Prevent saving empty gc_id in putUserDetails and putUserBackupInfo
  - Improved iOS Game Center login failure error message to suggest Email login
  - Added test: “rejects empty Game Center ID (iOS 14+ deprecated API bug)”
  - Added migration script: `scripts/fix-empty-game-center-ids.js` (+ --dry-run)
  - Added docs: `GAME_CENTER_FIX.md`
- Branch pushed to GitHub: `fix/game-center-ios-auth`.
- PR could not be created via GitHub API due to “Bad credentials”; workaround is creating PR via web.
- Staging-first plan agreed: devs deploy `fix/game-center-ios-auth` to staging, run migration dry-run, test login flows, watch logs, then proceed to production.

## Monitoring access + baseline
- Logstash/Kibana access provided:
  - URL: http://logstash.evilapples.com
  - user: evilapples
  - pass: wickedfruit
- Zendesk subdomain discovered: `evilstudios.zendesk.com` (evilapples.zendesk.com was wrong).
- Baseline Zendesk open ticket scan (2026-02-18 05:05 UTC): 49 open tickets, 17 login-related (~34.7%). Saved to `/tmp/zendesk-baseline.json`.
- Wrote monitoring helper notes: `/root/clawd-main/projects/evil-apples/monitoring-credentials.md`.

## clawd-diddit docs publishing fix
- Problem: docs were pushed to `master` but repo default branch is `main`, causing 404s.
- Resolved by rebasing/pushing changes to `main`. Files now exist at `projects/evil-apples/` on GitHub.

## Afoodable context (two-sided marketplace)
- Afoodable AI notes exist in `/root/clawd-main/memory/afoodable-ai.md`.
- Restaurant outreach system already built in `/root/clawd-main/projects/afoodable-restaurant-outreach/` (email sequences, scraper guides, launch plan, Instantly integration).
- User (Mitch) stated the restaurant campaign is already running in Instantly.
- Clarified Afoodable is two-sided: restaurants list discounted surplus; consumers buy discounted food.
- Discussed consumer lead sourcing idea (Misfits Market followers) but Mitch wants to think.

## CircleCI test output
- Our Game Center test passed.
- CircleCI had 1 unrelated failing test: `test/z_indexes-test.js` (collection missing / indexes undefined), plus Mongo NamespaceNotFound warnings; not caused by Game Center fix.

## Devs timing
- Mitch posted staging instructions to Slack; dev team in Argentina asleep (1am local).
