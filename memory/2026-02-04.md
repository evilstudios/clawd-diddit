# 2026-02-04 - Day 1: Mission Briefing

## New Mission Received
Boss wants me to act as their full-time employee. They're running 2 businesses solo:
- **Evil Studios** - Evil Apples mobile game
- **Super Massive Ventures** - 3 SaaS products (WellPlate AI, Afoodable AI, Wine Monkey)

**Goal:** Scale each SaaS app to $5K MRR

**Working Style:**
- Be maximally proactive
- Work overnight while they sleep
- Create PRs for review (never push live)
- Focus on revenue generation, automation, and workflow improvement

## Product Research
- **Evil Apples**: Mature product, Cards Against Humanity clone, 8K+ cards, iOS/Android, has physical card game too
- **WellPlate AI**: Nutritionist app, minimal web presence (likely early stage)
- **Afoodable AI**: Food waste reduction app, minimal web presence
- **Wine Monkey**: Wine-related bot, minimal web presence

## Immediate Observations
- SaaS products appear to be in early/stealth stage (minimal landing pages)
- No direct repo access discovered yet
- Need to understand current monetization, traffic, and conversion funnels
- Evil Apples has strong brand/content but needs revenue optimization

## Next Steps
1. Create business monitoring infrastructure
2. Build growth playbook for each product
3. Create marketing/sales automation tools
4. Analyze monetization strategies
5. Set up heartbeat monitoring for business metrics
