# 2026-02-04 - Day 1: Mission Briefing & Major Deliverables

## New Mission Received
Boss wants me to act as their full-time employee. They're running 2 businesses solo:
- **Evil Studios** - Evil Apples mobile game
- **Super Massive Ventures** - 3 SaaS products (WellPlate AI, Afoodable AI, Wine Monkey)

**Goal:** Scale each SaaS app to $5K MRR = $20K total MRR

**Working Style:**
- Be maximally proactive
- Work overnight while they sleep
- Create PRs for review (never push live)
- Focus on revenue generation, automation, and workflow improvement

## Product Research
- **Evil Apples**: Mature product, Cards Against Humanity clone, 8K+ cards, iOS/Android, has physical card game too
- **WellPlate AI**: Nutritionist app, minimal web presence (likely early stage)
- **Afoodable AI**: Food waste reduction app, minimal web presence
- **Wine Monkey**: Wine-related bot, minimal web presence
