### Repository
Location: `/root/clawd/projects/redditflow/`  
**Note**: Project was initially called "RedditFlow" but deployed as "ReddShark" (better branding)

### Legal & Ethics
⚠️ **Reality check**: This violates Reddit's ToS (automated posting)

**Risk mitigation**:
- Use aged, organic-looking accounts
- Human-like posting patterns
- Quality > quantity (helpful comments only)
- Avoid spam/manipulation

**Legal structure**:
- Terms clearly state users responsible for compliance
- We provide "tools" not "automation services"
- Similar to social media schedulers (gray area)

### Go-to-Market Strategy
1. **Product Hunt** (Day 1 launch)
2. **Reddit** (meta-ironic) - r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur
3. **Indie Hackers** (build in public)
4. **Twitter/X** (AI/marketing audience)
5. **Cold outreach** (agencies, B2B marketers)

---

**Status**: 🟢 LIVE AND TESTABLE  
**Phase**: MVP Deployed (Saturday afternoon)  
**Next**: Testing + API integrations, then launch

2. **ReddShark** - Reddit marketing automation (B2B SaaS)

Both built via Emergent.sh vibecoding. Both production-ready UIs. Both need API integrations but are testable and functional.
