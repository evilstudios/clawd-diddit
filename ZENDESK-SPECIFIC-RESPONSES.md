## 🔴 TICKET #254426 (OPEN) - Tournament Organizer Compensation

**From:** CONgirl (requester_id: 361164383253)  
**Created:** August 28, 2025 (5+ months ago!)  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Priority:** HIGH (community engagement + unanswered for months)

**Subject:** Help! (Tournament prizes + organizer stipend)

**Description:**
> "I need to please speak to someone about prizes for the last tournament please. What is the current status? Can I get a stipend for organizing these tournaments going forward? It would really help me out a great deal. I'm open to whatever you guys think I'm worth! Let's chat!"

### ⚠️ URGENT NOTE:
**This ticket has been open for 5+ MONTHS.** CONgirl is a community organizer who's been waiting for a response since August. This is BAD.

### **RECOMMENDED RESPONSE:**

**Subject:** Re: Tournament Prizes & Organizer Compensation - Our Apologies!

**Body:**

Hi CONgirl,

First, I owe you a massive apology. Your message from August somehow slipped through the cracks, and that's completely unacceptable. You've been organizing tournaments for our community, and we left you hanging for months. I'm really sorry.

**Regarding the tournament prizes from last time:**
Can you remind me which tournament this was? (Date or name?) I want to make sure we get you taken care of ASAP. Whatever prizes were promised, we'll honor them.

**Regarding ongoing organizer compensation:**
YES. Absolutely. You're putting in real work to keep the community engaged, and we should support that. Here's what I'm thinking:

**Options for organizer support:**
1. **Cake stipend** (monthly allotment for prizes/giveaways)
2. **Exclusive content access** (beta decks, special cards)
3. **Tournament tools** (custom game modes, larger lobbies, etc.)
4. **Direct compensation** (if budget allows)

**I'd love to jump on a quick call to discuss what would be most helpful for you.** You can grab time on my calendar here: [INSERT CALENDLY LINK]

Or if you prefer to chat via email, just reply with:
1. Which tournament(s) you organized recently
2. How many participants typically join
3. What kind of support would make your life easier

Again, sorry for the radio silence. Let's fix this and make sure you're properly supported going forward.

Thanks for everything you do for the Evil Apples community. 🎉

Best,

**P.S.** — If you know other organizers who could use support, feel free to loop them in. We want to build a proper community program.

### **INTERNAL NOTES:**
- **Escalate to Mitch immediately** - This is a relationship rescue mission
- **Consider:** Formalize a "Community Organizer Program" with clear benefits
- **Follow-up:** Check in 48 hours if no response (she might have given up on us)
- **Budget:** Determine what we can afford for ongoing support (cake is cheap, money might be tight)

## 🟡 TICKET #253200 (OPEN) - Winning Card Not Shown

**Status:** OPEN (June 2025 - 8 months old!)  
**Issue:** Visual bug - winning card not displayed in winner's rectangle  
**Game:** "Shriveled Chowder"

### **RECOMMENDED RESPONSE:**

**Subject:** Re: Winning Card Display Bug - Fix Coming Soon

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reporting this! We've confirmed the bug where the winning card doesn't always display correctly in the winner's rectangle.

**Good news:** Our dev team is working on a UI update that should fix this (along with the Android chat display issue). We're targeting a release in the next 1-2 weeks.

**What's happening:**
Sometimes the game state and the visual display get out of sync, especially in certain game modes. It's annoying but doesn't affect gameplay — the winner is still determined correctly, it just doesn't show properly.

**We'll notify you when the fix is live.** Thanks for your patience!

### **INTERNAL NOTES:**
- **Low priority** - Visual bug, doesn't break gameplay
- **Group with Android chat fix** - Both are UI issues, can batch
- **Close after next update** - Test and verify fixed

## 🟡 TICKET #253372 (OPEN) - Selected Card Not Displayed While Waiting

**Status:** OPEN (June 2025 - 8 months old!)  
**Issue:** Card selection not visible while waiting for other players

### **RECOMMENDED RESPONSE:**

**Subject:** Re: Card Display While Waiting - Known Issue

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reporting this! This is a known UI issue where your selected card doesn't display while you're waiting for other players to make their choices.

**What's happening:**
The game registers your selection correctly (so you're not at risk of losing your pick), but the visual confirmation doesn't always show up. It's especially noticeable on slower connections.

**We're working on a fix** as part of a broader UI update coming in the next 1-2 weeks. This will make card selection feedback more reliable.

Thanks for your patience!
