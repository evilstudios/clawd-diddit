# Voxable AI - Service Business Cold Email Sequence

## Campaign Overview
- **Platform:** Instantly.ai
- **Target:** Local service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, contractors, electricians, salons, locksmiths)
- **Goal:** Demo calls → trial signups
- **Sequence:** 4 emails over 10 days
- **Hook:** "You're losing 50%+ of leads to whoever responds first"

## Email 1: The Painful Truth (Day 0)

**Subject:** You just lost another lead to {{competitor}}

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Harsh truth: Over 50% of customers go with the first business that responds.

If you're not answering calls/texts/DMs instantly (even at 9pm on Saturday), you're losing half your leads to competitors who are.

We built Voxable to fix this—AI receptionist that answers:
- Phone calls
- Texts & WhatsApp
- Facebook/Instagram DMs
- Website chat
- Emails

24/7. Instant response. Books appointments directly into your calendar.

Want to see it in action? Call 267-550-0466 (it's the AI—try to stump it).

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
[Your Name]
Voxable AI
```

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with competitor pain (emotional trigger)
- 50% stat creates urgency
- Interactive demo (call the number) = engagement
- Multi-channel coverage = comprehensive solution

## Email 2: The Cost of Slow (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: You just lost another lead

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Following up because this is costing you real money.

Think about the last lead that called after hours or texted during a job. If they didn't hear back instantly, they called 3 more {{business_type}} companies.

One of them answered. They got the job.

Voxable makes sure YOU'RE the one who answers:
✅ Answers every call, text, DM, email—instantly
✅ Qualifies leads while you're on the job
✅ Books appointments directly into your calendar
✅ Works 24/7 (weekends, holidays, 2am)

No hiring. No training. No monthly receptionist salary.

Try the demo: Call 267-550-0466

10 minutes to see if this works for {{business_name}}?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Paints specific scenario they've experienced
- Shows cost (lost revenue, not just inconvenience)
- Clear value props in bullets
- Reinforces demo number

## Email 3: Social Proof + Guarantee (Day 6)

**Subject:** How {{similar_business}} stopped missing leads

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I work with a few {{business_type}} companies in {{city}} who had the same problem:

"Leads were calling, but we were on jobs. By the time we called back, they'd already booked someone else."

Since switching to Voxable:
- Every call/text answered instantly (even at midnight)
- Appointments booked automatically
- Zero missed leads

Mike B. (contractor): *"We haven't missed a single lead in 3 months."*

Jessica A. (salon owner): *"Clients comment on how responsive we are now."*

**Here's the deal:**
- 100% done-for-you setup (under 60 seconds)
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Cancel anytime

If it doesn't book you at least one extra job this month, you pay nothing.

Call the demo line to hear it yourself: 267-550-0466

Worth testing?

Best,
[Your Name]
Voxable AI
```

**Why This Works:**
- Testimonials from similar businesses (relatable)
- Risk reversal (money-back guarantee)
- Clear ROI promise (one extra job = pays for itself)

## Email 4: Breakup / Final Shot (Day 10)

**Subject:** Closing your file (unless...)

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I'll stop emailing you after this—I promise :)

Just want to make sure I'm not missing something:

Are you already handling after-hours calls/texts in a way that works? Or is this just not a priority right now?

If you're happy with your current setup, all good. But if you're losing even 1-2 leads per month to slow response times, that's thousands in lost revenue.

Last chance to test it risk-free: 267-550-0466

Either way, best of luck with {{business_name}}.

P.S. — If you know another {{business_type}} owner struggling with this, I'd love an intro.

**Why This Works:**
- "Permission to close" = often gets replies
- Asks diagnostic questions (opens conversation)
- Reinforces lost revenue cost
- Referral ask (expands reach)

## Competitor Differentiation

Most service businesses use:
- **Miss it entirely** (no system)
- **Voicemail** (slow, unprofessional)
- **Answering service** (expensive, robotic, limited hours)
- **VA/receptionist** (costly, limited availability)

**Voxable wins because:**
- TRUE 24/7 coverage (not business hours only)
- Multi-channel (not just phone)
- Instant (not "we'll call you back")
- Affordable (no $3k/month receptionist salary)
- Setup in 60 seconds (not weeks of training)
