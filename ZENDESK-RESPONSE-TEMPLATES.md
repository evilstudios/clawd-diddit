## 🐛 TEMPLATE 1: Android Chat Display Bug

**Use for:** Tickets #254633, #254658, #254660, #254848, #255072

**Subject:** Re: Chat Display Issue - Fix in Progress

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reporting this! You're absolutely right — there's a bug affecting Android users where the system navigation bar is blocking the chat input and send button.

**Good news:** Our dev team is working on a fix right now. This is our top priority, and we're aiming to have it resolved in the next 48-72 hours.

**What's happening:**
A recent update inadvertently caused the chat UI to be hidden behind the navigation bar on certain Android devices. We've identified the issue and are testing a fix now.

**We'll notify you as soon as the update is live.** In the meantime, thanks for your patience and for sticking with us! Your feedback as a beta tester is incredibly valuable.

**P.S.** We're also looking into why some users experienced notification issues again — that's on our radar too.

If you have any other feedback or issues, feel free to reach out!

Best,

## 🔒 TEMPLATE 2: "You Must Be Logged In" Error

**Use for:** Tickets #254944, #255046, #255077, #255084

**Subject:** Re: "You Must Be Logged In" Error - Troubleshooting Steps

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Sorry you're seeing that frustrating error! This usually happens when there's a temporary session issue between the app and our servers.

**Here's how to fix it:**

1. **Force close** the app completely (don't just minimize it)
2. **Clear the app cache:**
   - **iOS:** Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Evil Apples > Offload App (then reinstall)
   - **Android:** Settings > Apps > Evil Apples > Storage > Clear Cache
3. **Restart your device**
4. **Open the app** and log in again using your preferred method (email, SMS, or Game Center)

**If that doesn't work:**
- Try logging out and back in using the **email magic link** method (we'll send you a login link)
- Make sure you're on the latest version of the app (check your app store for updates)

Let me know if you're still seeing the error after trying these steps, and I'll dig deeper!

## 👤 TEMPLATE 3: Account Recovery (Game Center/SMS)

**Use for:** Lost account tickets like #254904, #254981, #255007, #255038

**Subject:** Re: Account Recovery Help

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I can help you recover your account! First, let me check what we can find.

**To locate your account, I need a bit more info:**

1. **What email address or phone number** did you originally use?
2. **What was your username** in the game?
3. **Do you remember any decks or purchases** you had?
4. **What device/platform** did you play on originally? (iOS or Android)

**Important to know:**
- If your account was **only backed up to Game Center or Google Play** and you switched devices, we may not be able to recover it if it wasn't linked to an email/SMS.
- If you had **in-app purchases**, we can verify them through Apple/Google receipts.

**Once I have this info, I'll do my best to track down your account and get you back in the game!**

In the meantime, here's how to **prevent this in the future:**
- Go to **Settings > Account** in the app
- Set up **email backup** (we'll send you a magic link to log in from any device)

Let me know those details and I'll get started!

**Subject:** Re: Tournament Prizes & Organizer Compensation

**Body:**

Hi CONgirl,

Thanks for reaching out — and thanks for organizing tournaments! That takes real effort and we appreciate you bringing the community together.

**Regarding the last tournament prizes:**
Let me check on the status and get back to you ASAP. Can you confirm which tournament this was (date or name)?

**Regarding compensation for organizing future tournaments:**
I love the idea of supporting community organizers! Let me bring this to our team and see what we can do. A few questions to help me make the case:

1. How many tournaments have you organized so far?
2. About how many participants typically join?
3. What kind of support would be most helpful? (Cake stipend, special decks, prizes for winners, etc.)

I'll get back to you soon with an update on both fronts. In the meantime, keep being awesome! 🎉

## 📝 TEMPLATE 6: Abuse Report (False Positive)

**Use for:** Abuse reports that aren't actually abusive

**Subject:** Re: Your Abuse Report

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reporting this. I've reviewed the report and taken appropriate action.

**A quick note:** Evil Apples is designed to be edgy and offensive — that's kind of the point! 😈 Some usernames, avatars, and card plays might be shocking, but unless they violate our actual rules (illegal content, real threats, etc.), they're fair game.

**If someone is truly harassing you or making the game unpleasant:**
- You can **mute** them in-game (blocks their chat messages)
- You can **leave** games they're in
- Report them if they're doing something actually harmful

**What we DO take action on:**
- Illegal content (child exploitation, real threats)
- Coordinated harassment
- Bot/spam accounts

Thanks for looking out for the community!

## 🎂 TEMPLATE 7: Free Cake Not Awarded

**Use for:** Users who watched ad but didn't get cake

**Subject:** Re: Free Cake Not Awarded - We'll Credit You!

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Ugh, that's frustrating! Watching an ad and not getting the reward is the WORST.

**I've manually credited your account** with [X] cake to make up for it. You should see it in your balance now!

**Why this happens:**
Sometimes there's a hiccup between the ad network and our servers. We're working on making this more reliable.

**If it happens again:**
- Try force-closing the app and reopening
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- Let us know and we'll credit you again!

Sorry for the hassle — enjoy your cake! 🎂
